# Stone & Salt — Concept Brief
## Commercial-Primary Positioning | Updated: February 15, 2026

---

## The Problem

Commercial property managers and facilities directors in Greater Cincinnati's northern suburbs face critical operational challenges:

- **Vendor fragmentation:** Managing separate contractors for landscaping (spring-fall) and snow removal (winter) creates accountability gaps
- **Liability exposure:** Slip-and-fall incidents on uncleared properties result in lawsuits; property managers need documented service for legal protection
- **Unreliable service:** National chains (BrightView: 1.3★) are impersonal; "guy with a truck" operators don't answer phones during emergencies
- **Budget unpredictability:** Per-push pricing creates cash flow chaos; property managers need predictable seasonal costs for annual budgeting
- **Communication black holes:** No confirmation of service completion, no documentation, no direct line to decision-makers

---

## The Solution

**Stone & Salt** — Professional year-round grounds management for commercial properties that can't afford excuses.

**Primary Service:** Commercial Grounds Maintenance + Integrated Snow Removal
**Secondary Service:** Residential Hardscapes (high-value projects, referral source)

**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"One vendor. Four seasons. Zero gaps. Your property stays professional—and you stay sane."*

## The Operator

**Partnership Structure: 50/50**

**Partner 2 (Field Operations):**

| **Equipment** | Have snow gear, need mowing tractor | Limits commercial grounds capacity until acquired |
| **Pricing** | Locked from PRICING_BENCHMARKS.md | Ready for website/proposals |
| **Phone number** | Placeholder (513) 555-0123 | Update before launch |

## Competitive Landscape

**Top Threats:**
1. **Wimberg Landscaping** — 4.4-4.5★, $5M+, 60+ employees, scale advantage
2. **Schill Grounds Management** — $50M+ regional, commercial-only
3. **BrightView** — $2.7B national, terrible reviews (1.3★), impersonal

**Stone & Salt Gap:**
- No local competitor offers premium design-build + reliable maintenance + integrated snow with owner accountability
- Year-round single vendor positioning is unique in messaging (though others offer both services)
- Fast response (48-72 hour proposals) vs. competitors' slow follow-up

**Common Customer Complaints (Our Opportunities):**
1. Unreliability / No-shows
2. Poor communication
3. Inconsistent crews
4. Project delays
5. Billing problems

---

## Design Problems to Solve

1. **Trust without track record:** New company winning commercial contracts against 40+ year incumbents
2. **Sales cycle management:** 3-6 month commercial sales cycles require pipeline discipline
3. **Seasonal cash flow:** Snow is supplementary (Cincinnati: 15-23"/year), not foundational
4. **Route efficiency:** Commercial properties dispersed across 45-min radius
5. **Documentation systems:** Commercial clients require timestamped service logs

## Customer Acquisition Strategy

**Primary Channel: Google Local Services Ads**
- Cost: $23-25/lead
- CAC: $125-165
- Why: Pay-per-lead, Google Verified badge, high commercial intent

**Secondary: Direct Property Manager Outreach**
- Target: 50 property management companies
- Method: LinkedIn + email + phone
- Goal: 10 conversations → 3 proposals → 1 contract

**Tertiary: Referrals**
- Highest quality leads, lowest CAC
- Incentivize: $200-500 per closed referral

---

## Decision: GO — Commercial-Primary

**Rationale:**
- Validated market: $500-700M local serviceable market
- Clear gap: No competitor owns "year-round reliability" positioning
- Higher LTV: Commercial = $95K-$375K LTV vs. residential = $40K-$100K
- Predictable revenue: Annual contracts vs. one-time projects
- Validated pricing: PRICING_BENCHMARKS.md locked

**Success Conditions:**
1. LLC + insurance secured by March 1
2. 50 property manager conversations by March 15
3. 3 active commercial proposals by April 1
4. First commercial contract signed by April 15
5. Website live with commercial-primary messaging by March 1

**Risk Factors:**
- 3-6 month commercial sales cycle (start outreach immediately)
- Labor shortage (80% of operators report challenges)
- Cincinnati's mild winters = unreliable snow revenue

# 🚨 Stone & Salt: Commercial-Only Launch Kit

This document contains the exact copy, scripts, and strategies for a **Paid Ads & Direct Outreach** launch that bypasses address verification delays.

**CRITICAL RULE:** All messaging is strictly **COMMERCIAL ONLY**. No driveways. No residential.

## 1. The "Gatekeeper" Phone Script
**Goal:** Filter out residential callers in the first 5 seconds.

**When the phone rings:**
> "Stone & Salt Commercial Dispatch. Are you calling about a commercial property or a residence?"

**If Residence:**
> "I apologize, but due to the storm severity, we are currently restricted to emergency commercial contracts only. We are not servicing residential driveways at this time." (Hang up).

**If Commercial:**
> "Great. We have crews active in Liberty Township. What is the address and square footage of the lot?"

## 5. The "Neighbor" Script (Direct Outreach)
**Goal:** Fill route gaps by selling to businesses next door to your current clients.

**Scenario:** You are plowing "Client A." You see "Business B" across the street has an unplowed lot.
**Action:** Call Business B (or walk in if open).

**Script:**
> "Hi, this is [Name] from Stone & Salt Landscaping.
>
> I'm actually calling because we're currently plowing the [Neighbor's Name] lot right across the street from you.
>
> Since my heavy equipment is already on-site, I can offer you a 'Route Density' rate to clear your lot while we're here. It saves me travel time, so I can pass that savings to you.
>
> We can have you cleared and salted by [Time]. Would you like me to add you to the list?"

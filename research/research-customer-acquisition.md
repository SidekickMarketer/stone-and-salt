# Customer acquisition research for Stone & Salt in the Cincinnati commercial landscaping market

## What the Cincinnati commercial grounds market implies for acquisition

Commercial landscaping and snow removal in your core suburbs is a relationship-and-process sale more than a “click-to-buy” sale: property managers and facilities leaders generally prioritize vendor reliability (response time, documentation, insurance, scheduling discipline) and risk reduction as much as price. A useful way to model this is that most of the “selling” happens before the RFP—getting on an approved vendor list, building familiarity, and being the contractor who answers quickly and communicates cleanly—then bids become a confirmation step rather than a cold evaluation. This is consistent with what a local public-sector landscaping RFP requires: contractors must submit detailed schedules shortly after award, coordinate directly with property managers, and meet time-sensitive expectations tied to curb appeal and operations. citeturn16view0

Seasonality in the Cincinnati area changes which channels produce urgency. A typical growing season in the area (based on frost dates used for Cincinnati) is roughly late April through late October, which tends to concentrate landscape improvement/cleanup decisions in spring and again in early fall. citeturn25search2 Snowfall creates short-notice purchasing windows and “prove it now” vendor behavior; Cincinnati winter snowfall averages have been reported around ~21.5 inches per season (local reporting referencing National Weather Service data), which is enough to sustain snow contracts but still makes individual storms the real demand spikes. citeturn25search7

A practical implication for your acquisition system: you want one channel that can generate near-term inbound (to keep pipeline moving), and one channel that reliably creates decision-maker conversations mid-cycle (to land 6–8 annual contracts on a 3–6 month sales cycle). The research below supports a blended approach: (1) paid local intent capture for near-term opportunities, and (2) a structured outbound + networking motion to property managers/HOA managers/facilities directors where the “real” volume of recurring commercial contracts typically lives. citeturn7view0turn11view0

**Confidence in this section:** medium-high (seasonality and procurement rigor are well-supported; exact buying calendars vary by asset class and manager).

## Google Local Services Ads and paid search in the Cincinnati market

Local Services Ads (LSAs) behave differently than standard Google Ads. LSAs are ranked through a Local Services auction that considers bid and “overall profile quality.” citeturn31search2 Google’s own overview materials also describe ranking as strongly influenced by proximity, reviews, and responsiveness, which means operational discipline (answering fast, not missing calls/messages) is part of “marketing” performance. citeturn31search1 Lead mechanics matter for cost expectations: message leads are “typically priced lower” than comparable phone leads, and message pricing is influenced by the estimated likelihood a customer will book you (including whether they contacted other advertisers). citeturn31search7

### LSA timing to first qualified leads in practice

Account readiness is a real gating factor. Google screening/verification commonly takes “about 3–4 weeks after you submit your verification documents.” citeturn0search0 If you launch LSAs as a new brand with limited reviews, plan for a ramp where speed-to-answer and review generation are as important as budget, because ranking is explicitly tied to responsiveness and reviews. citeturn31search1turn31search2

### Cincinnati-specific LSA cost per lead vs best-available benchmarks

Public sources rarely publish category costs at the level of “commercial landscaping Cincinnati” specifically; most benchmarks are national or multi-market averages, and LSAs for landscaping also tend to skew residential unless your intake and messaging aggressively qualify for commercial. That said, the best-available benchmark ranges still help bound expectations:

* One published multi-category LSA benchmark set lists “Landscaper” average cost per lead around $39 (with many verticals higher and lower). citeturn2search10  
* Another contractor-focused LSA overview cites a typical LSA range around $25–$45/lead, while also noting geography and competitiveness drive variance. citeturn12search12  
* A broader LSA cost discussion (including quotes from other industry sources) frames LSA CPL as often $20–$120+ depending on market and service line. citeturn2search11  

**Where your earlier $125–$165 number can still be correct:** if your raw CPL is moderate but only a small share of LSA contacts are truly commercial-property decision makers, your *cost per qualified commercial conversation* can climb into (or above) that $125–$165 range quickly. This is especially true if you include phone leads (higher priced than messages) and you disqualify most homeowner calls. citeturn31search7turn2search11

### Conversion ranges you can use to model LSA CAC

There is no single “standard” lead→contract conversion rate published for commercial landscaping LSAs; however, you can triangulate plausible ranges by combining:  
1) the fact that LSAs are responsiveness-sensitive and tend to reward fast follow-up, citeturn31search1turn31search2 and  
2) landscaping selling benchmarks for later-stage closing.

A large landscaping sales benchmark survey (190+ companies) reports an average close rate of ~51% for commercial projects, and ~47% for snow & ice—interpretable as the probability that a proposal becomes signed work once you’re at proposal stage. citeturn7view0turn7view1

A defensible modeling approach is to treat proposal-close as relatively strong (around ~50% for well-scoped commercial bids), and model uncertainty in the earlier steps (qualification, meeting set, proposal issuance). citeturn7view0turn31search7

### Seasonal variation for paid search

Even when LSAs remain active year-round, search-driven lead costs and volumes are seasonal for landscaping. A landscaping PPC benchmark analysis reports that costs per lead can be around ~$50 in spring, near ~$100 in summer, and exceed ~$200 in winter. citeturn12search0 That benchmark is for Google Ads (PPC), not LSAs, but it is still a strong indicator that paid-intent channels experience large seasonality swings tied to demand (spring cleanup, bed refresh, mowing season starts; winter slowdowns unless snow services are heavily promoted). citeturn12search0turn25search2

**Confidence in this section:** medium (LSA mechanics and ranking factors are high-confidence; Cincinnati-specific CPL and conversion rates are inherently variable and not well published).

## Direct outreach to property managers, HOA managers, and facilities directors

For your ICP (property managers, facilities directors, HOA managers), outbound works best as a multi-touch sequence—not because any single touch is magical, but because modern response benchmarks are low enough that you need repetition, channel switching, and credibility stacking (reviews, insurance, “here’s how we run schedules,” references). Response-rate benchmarks below are useful because they quantify the math behind persistence.

### Channel-by-channel response benchmarks to use as planning numbers

Cold email: large-scale cold email benchmarking commonly lands in **~1%–5% reply rate** territory across campaigns, with wide variance driven by list quality and message relevance. citeturn8search3 A separate outreach study reports an average reply rate around 5.8% in its dataset (also noting variation over time). citeturn5search16

Cold calling: a large cold-calling dataset (10,000 calls) reports an average cold call “success rate” (meetings booked from conversations) of **4.82%**. citeturn11view0 The same report indicates meeting bookings clustered at **11am and 2pm**, and also cites 4–5pm as a strong window; Thursday produced the most booked meetings within their sample. citeturn11view1

LinkedIn outreach: response rates vary by industry and targeting quality, but one particularly actionable benchmark from LinkedIn’s own recruiter guidance is *timing*: **65% of InMail responses arrive within 24 hours and 90% within one week**—useful for structuring follow-ups and deciding when to call after a message. citeturn18search10

Direct mail: a direct mail report citing DMA benchmarks states average response rates around **2.7%–4.4%**, and shows response rates by format often clustering in the **~3.4%–5.7%** band (letter-size envelope, postcard, oversized envelope, tabloid). citeturn20view1turn20view0 This is not “commercial landscaping-specific,” but it supports using a lightweight mailer to property managers/HOA managers as a credibility amplifier when paired with email/calls. citeturn20view1turn8search3

### Best contact method by persona in your market

A single “best” method rarely wins; the higher-performing pattern is to match the channel to the persona and the ask:

Facilities directors: these buyers respond well to peer networks and professional groups because they are risk-driven and operationally busy. Joining the local chapter of entity["organization","International Facility Management Association","cincinnati chapter"] puts you in recurring proximity to facility leaders and vendor ecosystem partners. citeturn4search0turn4search8

Commercial property managers: managers who oversee office/industrial/retail frequently engage through industry associations and recurring events. The entity["organization","Institute of Real Estate Management","chapter 9 cincinnati dayton"] in the region exists specifically to serve real estate managers and runs events/networking/education, which is structurally aligned with how vendor relationships form. citeturn4search1turn4search5

HOA managers and board members: the entity["organization","Community Associations Institute","hoa industry trade group"] positions itself as an education/advocacy hub for community associations and managers, and it also maintains directories of credentialed professionals and accredited association management companies—useful for identifying firms and validating who actually manages communities. citeturn4search2turn4search22

### How to find HOA boards and vendor decision makers

In many communities, the board is the legal decision-maker while the management company runs the vendor process. A practical way to reach boards without guessing is to start with municipal or community resources that list neighborhood associations and then route through the management company contact listed on the association’s site or documents. For example, the City of Blue Ash publishes a list of neighborhood associations/HOAs (a model you can replicate across nearby municipalities where similar lists exist). citeturn26search18 HOA and condo websites also commonly publish the current property management company and contact instructions, which can reveal the management firm controlling the vendor flow. citeturn26search20turn26search17

**Confidence in this section:** high for response-rate benchmarks (they are directly sourced), and medium for best-contact guidance (it’s a synthesized playbook that depends on asset class and manager preferences).

## Referral programs and partner channels that fit B2B grounds management

Referral programs in commercial landscaping tend to work best when structured around (a) risk-free professionalism and (b) a clear reward that does not create awkwardness for the referrer.

### Incentive structures that map to your deal sizes

Finder’s-fee structures vary widely by industry and level of involvement, but one common benchmark range cited for referral fees in professional services is roughly **1%–5% for low-involvement introductions**, and higher for deeper involvement. citeturn14search3 For your annual contract values, a practical translation is:

* **Flat referral fee** (simple): e.g., $250–$1,000 on signed annual maintenance contract, paid after first invoice clears.
* **Percentage of first-year revenue** (scales with deal size): e.g., 1%–3% of first-year contract value for a clean intro with no selling effort required.

The “right” choice often depends on who you’re asking: property managers and HOA managers may have ethics policies that restrict personal payments, so a safer version is a **charitable donation in the referrer’s name** or a **service credit** applied to the referring property (where allowed and appropriate). The key is that the value is meaningful but not identity-threatening. citeturn14search3turn7view0

### When to ask in the customer lifecycle

Benchmarks for InMail timing show most responses occur within a week, which is a helpful analogy for referrals: ask at a point of high satisfaction, then follow up once while the positive experience is fresh. citeturn18search10 For recurring services, this commonly aligns with:  
1) after the first “wins trust” milestone (first month of flawless service),  
2) after a visible seasonal success (spring cleanup or first snow event handled cleanly), and  
3) shortly before renewal discussions begin (because referrals are easier when the customer is already reaffirming value). citeturn14search1turn7view0

### HOA and commercial bidding cycles that influence referral timing

If an HOA’s landscape maintenance contract is often bid out every 3–5 years (a commonly cited contract-duration pattern in HOA landscaping), the best referral value can come from being introduced as an auxiliary vendor first (enhancements, irrigation repairs, storm cleanup, snow) and then becoming positioned for the “full contract” the next time it cycles. citeturn14search2turn13search1

**Confidence in this section:** medium (referral-fee bench ranges are sourced; the “best structure” depends on ethics/compliance norms by organization type).

## CAC benchmarks and a recommended channel mix with monthly budget

### A grounded CAC target using LTV:CAC

A commonly cited rule of thumb is that an LTV-to-CAC ratio of **3 or higher** indicates an attractive, scalable acquisition engine. citeturn21search1 Using your stated commercial CLV range ($95k–$375k), even a conservative 3:1 benchmark implies CAC capacity of roughly $32k–$125k over the full customer lifetime—meaning you can afford to invest in acquisition systems that look “expensive” in the short term (like networking sponsorships or dedicated outbound time) as long as they reliably produce multi-year contracts. citeturn21search1turn7view0

### Marketing budget ranges to anchor your monthly plan

A landscaping industry budgeting guideline suggests ~5% of revenue for maintaining/growing, and ~7%–10% for aggressive growth or entering new markets. citeturn5search4 Applied to a $325k Year 1 target, that implies roughly **$1.9k–$2.7k/month** at 7%–10% once revenue is flowing, with a rational case to front-load spend during the first 3–6 months because your sales cycle is long. citeturn5search4turn0search0

### Channel-level CAC modeling

Below is a practical CAC model for Year 1 planning. Costs are shown as ranges because the published benchmarks are not Cincinnati-commercial specific, and the biggest driver is how aggressively you qualify leads for “commercial decision maker” vs residential. citeturn2search11turn7view0turn8search3

| Channel | Cost inputs grounded in sources | Conversion logic (planning ranges) | Implied CAC range (per new annual contract) | Notes on what improves performance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Google LSAs | Typical published CPL ranges from ~$25–$45 in many markets, with broader ranges up to ~$20–$120+ depending on category/market. citeturn12search12turn2search11 | Use proposal-close ~51% once quoted, but assume early-stage qualification/meeting/proposal filters create a wide lead→win range (often single digits). citeturn7view0turn31search7 | Roughly **$900–$16k**, depending primarily on % of leads that are truly commercial and how many reach proposal stage | Review velocity + responsiveness affect ranking; message leads often cheaper; tight service-area targeting prevents wasted leads. citeturn31search1turn31search7 |
| Google search PPC (non-LSA) | Landscaping PPC lead costs can swing sharply by season (reports of ~$50 spring, ~$100 summer, $200+ winter). citeturn12search0 | Better for “commercial landscaping” keywords than LSAs in many markets; model similar funnel but expect higher intent variance | Roughly **$1.5k–$20k** depending on seasonal CPL and close rate | Use dedicated commercial landing pages and fast follow-up; concentrate spend in spring/fall windows. citeturn12search0turn25search2 |
| Outbound email + phone + LinkedIn sequence | Reply rates often ~1%–5% for cold email, with meetings from conversations reported ~4.82% in a cold-calling dataset. citeturn8search3turn11view0 | Model by meetings created per 100 targeted accounts; proposal close ~51% once in proposal stage. citeturn7view0 | Often **$600–$6k** when you account for labor/time; can be lower cash-cost but time-intensive | Multi-touch sequences outperform single channel; call timing matters (midday + late afternoon windows). citeturn11view1turn8search4 |
| Direct mail to commercial/HOA managers | DMA-cited response rates ~2.7%–4.4% overall; format benchmarks often ~3.4%–5.7%. citeturn20view1turn20view0 | Treat as a meeting catalyst, not the whole funnel; pair with outbound email/calls | Often **$1k–$8k** depending on list quality, package cost, and follow-up system | Works best when it contains operational proof (insurance, schedule rigor, photos) and is followed up within days. citeturn20view1turn31search1 |
| Referral program | Referral fee benchmarks in services often discussed as 1%–5% for low-involvement, higher with involvement. citeturn14search3 | Close rates high because trust is transferred; model close rate materially higher than cold outbound | Often **$500–$3k** (depending on reward) | Ask after a “proof” milestone and make the reward easy/ethical (credit/donation if needed). citeturn18search10turn14search3 |
| Networking via industry groups | Membership/events are a cash cost; conversion is relationship-driven | Leads tend to be slower but often higher quality | Highly variable; often **$1k–$10k** early, then drops as relationships compound | Focus on recurring attendance and becoming the “safe vendor” in the room. citeturn4search5turn4search8 |

### Recommended channel mix and monthly budget for Year 1

A pragmatic “ramp” budget (front-loaded for a 3–6 month sales cycle) is to plan around the aggressive-growth guideline (7%–10% of revenue) but allocate more heavily in months 1–6 to create pipeline before revenue arrives. citeturn5search4turn0search0

A workable mix (illustrative, not a constraint) based on the published benchmarks and channel dynamics above:

* Paid local intent capture (LSA + PPC): **35%–45%** of monthly spend (keeps inbound coming, especially spring/fall). citeturn12search0turn31search7  
* Outbound + list building + light direct mail: **35%–45%** (this is the main engine for commercial contracts and lets you control account selection). citeturn8search3turn11view0turn20view1  
* Networking + association participation: **10%–15%** (compounding trust channel for facilities/property managers). citeturn4search1turn4search8  
* Referral incentives: **5%–10%** (only paid on success if structured as a finder’s fee or credit). citeturn14search3turn21search1  

**Confidence in this section:** medium (the math is consistent with sourced benchmarks; real CAC will hinge on qualification rigor and your sales process throughput).

## Top initial targets to approach with specific contact approaches

These targets are selected to match: (a) multi-property footprint (so one relationship can yield multiple sites), (b) proximity to your core suburbs, and (c) evidence of commercial/association management work or major development activity. citeturn32view0turn33view0turn30view0

The contact approaches below are optimized for the response-rate reality: assume cold email replies are often 1%–5%, and meetings booked from conversations often require persistence. citeturn8search3turn11view0

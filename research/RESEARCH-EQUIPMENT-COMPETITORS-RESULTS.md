## Equipment Research: Compact Tractor for Estate Mowing

### NEW Equipment Pricing

| Model | Base Price | Package (with loader + 60" mower) | Notes |
|-------|------------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| **John Deere 1025R** | $18,764 | ~$22,000-25,000 | AutoConnect deck system, 25 HP, premium brand |
| **Kubota BX2380** | $18,790 | ~$21,000-24,000 | LA344 loader, 23 HP, strong dealer network |

**Financing:**
- John Deere: $325 off with 2 qualifying implements (current promo)
- Kubota: 0% APR for 36 months (2025 promo)
- Typical payment: ~$400-600/month depending on down payment

### USED Equipment Pricing (Cincinnati Area)

| Model | Hours | Price Range | Condition |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| John Deere 1023E | 173 hrs | $17,500 | 2021, clean |
| John Deere 1025R | 137 hrs | $17,500 | 2023, loader + 60" deck |
| Kubota L275 (older) | unknown | $5,500 | 1985 model, 4WD |
| Various used compact | 200-500 hrs | $12,000-18,000 | Facebook Marketplace |

**Used Market Insight:**
- 2-5 year old tractors with 100-300 hours: $15,000-18,000
- Depreciation slows after year 3
- Key: Verify maintenance records, check for loader/mower inclusion

### LEASE/RENTAL Options

| Provider | Monthly Rate | Term | Notes |
|----------|--------------|------|-------|
| Equipment rental (Baxla) | $800-2,400 | Monthly | Short-term flexibility |
| TractorHouse listings | $2,100+ | Monthly | Varies by model |
| Dealer financing | $400-600 | 36-60 months | 0% promos available |

**Rental consideration:** $800-2,400/month is expensive for long-term use. Better to buy/finance if keeping 3+ years.

## Recommendation: Equipment Strategy

**For 15-25 estate mowing clients Year 1:**

### Option A: Buy Used (RECOMMENDED)
- **Target:** 2-3 year old John Deere 1025R or Kubota BX2380
- **Price:** $15,000-18,000
- **Hours:** Under 300
- **Must include:** Loader + 60" mower deck
- **Why:** Best value, immediate availability, proven reliability

### Option B: Buy New with Financing
- **Price:** $22,000-25,000 package
- **Payment:** ~$400-500/month (0% for 36 months)
- **Why:** Warranty, latest features, relationship with dealer

### Option C: Rent (Not Recommended for 15-25 clients)
- **Cost:** $800-2,400/month
- **Why avoid:** More expensive than financing over 12+ months

**My recommendation:** Buy used around $16,000-17,000. Finance $15k at 0% if available, or pay cash. Keep 5+ years.

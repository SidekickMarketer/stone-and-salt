# Compact tractors and commercial mowing alternatives for Stone & Salt in Greater Cincinnati

## Executive summary

entity["company","Stone & Salt","grounds management startup"] is planning equipment acquisition for commercial-primary grounds management work based in entity["place","Liberty Township","Butler County, OH, US"] within the entity["place","Greater Cincinnati","metro area, OH-KY-IN, US"] market. The Year 1 target workload—servicing 15–25 estate mowing clients—implies that mowing productivity (acres/hour), uptime, and rapid service turnaround are the first-order drivers of profitability; “do-everything” versatility is valuable, but typically secondary during a mowing-heavy ramp-up.

Across the sub-compact tractor candidates (entity["company","John Deere","ag and turf equipment manufacturer"] 1025R, entity["company","Kubota","tractor and equipment manufacturer"] BX2380/BX2680, entity["company","Mahindra","tractor manufacturer"] eMax 25), all can physically run 60" mid-mount decks and front loaders, but they differ materially in (a) warranty coverage for commercial use, (b) available promotional financing/cash discounts, and (c) how efficiently they handle weekly route mowing versus a purpose-built commercial zero-turn mower. The compact tractor path can look cheaper on “equipment-only” total cost of ownership (TCO), but once operator time is valued (a practical necessity for a service business), commercial zero-turn mowing tends to dominate for estate-route mowing.

Key findings from primary sources:

- **New package pricing (tractor + loader + 60" deck)** clusters around the **low-to-mid $20Ks** for Kubota BX packages quoted by dealers, and the **high $20Ks** for John Deere 1025R packages when configured with loader + 60D deck by a local dealer program (with some packages bundling extra implements). citeturn0search28turn17view0turn28view0turn16search0  
- **Promotional financing** is currently strongest/clearest for:  
  - John Deere 1025R: **0% APR for 60 months** (with alternative cash/discount programs that may be mutually exclusive). citeturn5view3turn8view1  
  - Kubota BX Series: **$0 down, 0% APR up to 36 months** (offer window shown through **02/28/2026**). citeturn28view0  
  - Mahindra eMax: **0% up to 72 months** plus cash back options (structure depends on region/zip and “tractor with attachment”). citeturn21view0  
- **Warranty structure differs sharply for commercial use**: Kubota’s BX powertrain coverage is shorter for commercial use than for residential use (36 months/2000 hours powertrain under “Commercial Use” in Kubota’s 2025+ warranty chart). citeturn19view0 Mahindra advertises a 7-year powertrain warranty for eMax-class machines (up to 3,000 hours) and publishes detailed tractor warranty policy documents. citeturn20view0turn18search6  
- **Commercial 60"+ zero-turn strategy**: For commercial mowing, warranties and cut-platform features are purpose-built. John Deere’s Z900-series pages document **3-year bumper-to-bumper warranties** with hour caps and “no hour limitation” in the first 24 months for M and R series. citeturn32search0 Exmark’s Lazer Z X-Series product pages show **5-year/1500-hour warranty** with no hour limit the first two years, and Exmark publishes a contractor lease structure (24–36 month terms with annual hour options). citeturn18search11turn31search13 Scag publishes explicit commercial warranty terms (2 years for certain commercial machines) and list prices by model. citeturn32search7turn32search15  
- **Renting is a credible bridge** for occasional tractor work or for short-term coverage during failures, with published daily/weekly rates for 25–35 HP compact tractors and 60" zero-turns. Examples include “tractor rate same with or without loader” at one rental source and published 60" zero-turn daily/weekly pricing at others. citeturn31search0turn31search4turn31search12turn31search5  

Recommendation for Year 1 (budget unspecified):

- **Primary acquisition**: buy (or finance) a **commercial 60–61" zero-turn mower** as the core revenue tool, sized for route efficiency and client expectations. Use the strongest available **commercial warranty + service network** in your 1-hour radius. John Deere Z900 and Exmark Lazer Z X-Series both publish commercial warranty structures designed for high hour accumulation. citeturn32search0turn18search11  
- **Secondary capability**: **rent** a compact tractor (or similar) for loader/implement work until non-mowing services justify ownership; then evaluate a **used** sub-compact tractor package or a new tractor if promotional terms plus expected utilization make sense. Published compact tractor rental rates (daily/weekly) make this economically rational when loader/implement utilization is episodic. citeturn31search0turn31search5turn31search2  
- **Contingency**: if demand accelerates or if you add snow/mulch/landscape install work, acquire a sub-compact tractor with loader as a “second machine.” For tractor brand choice, prioritize: (1) nearest high-capacity service center, (2) commercial warranty fit, (3) parts availability, then (4) initial price.

## Operating context and workload assumptions

Stone & Salt’s stated Year 1 service plan is **15–25 estate mowing clients** (budget not specified). With estates, mowing time often includes: travel time between properties, trimming/blowing, variable terrain, and higher finish expectations; equipment choices that reduce mowing hours per week reduce schedule volatility and improve capacity for upsells (mulch, shrub work, seasonal cleanups).

To make tractor-vs-zero-turn comparisons analytically consistent, the report models mowing as a fixed “acre-cuts” workload and compares hours required under different productivity assumptions. A baseline “midpoint” workload used later in TCO tables (editable) is:

- 20 clients × 1.5 mowable acres × 28 mowing weeks = 840 acre-cuts (assumption).
- Effective mowing productivity (assumptions, vary by terrain and trimming proportion):  
  - Commercial 60" zero-turn: 3.5 acres/hour  
  - 60" mid-mount deck on sub-compact tractor: 2.0 acres/hour  

These assumptions are used only for the TCO tables and are intentionally separated from sourced specifications and pricing. The central strategic implication is robust even under moderate changes: sub-compact tractors can mow, but commercial zero-turn mowers are optimized for mowing throughput and are typically the better “first” tool for a mowing-route business.

## Equipment classes and capability comparison

### Sub-compact tractors with 60" mid-mount decks

The tractor options in scope can be configured as “load-and-mow” systems: tractor + front loader + mid-mount mower deck. In that configuration they add utility (material handling, snow, light grading), but mowing is typically slower than commercial zero-turn mowing due to turning radius, ground speed, and maneuvering around landscaping features.

Representative sourced specifications:

- **John Deere 1025R** key specs shown on the model page include **engine power 23.9 hp**, **PTO power 18.2 hp**, **lift capacity 758 lb**, and **shipping weight 1,556 lb** (as displayed in the “Key Specs” module). citeturn5view3  
- **Kubota BX2380/BX2680** official BX80 spec sheet includes (selected):  
  - BX2380: **21.6 gross HP**, **17.7 PTO HP**, **680 lb 3-point lift capacity at 24" behind pin**, **1,443 lb tractor weight with ROPS**. citeturn29view0turn30view0  
  - BX2680: **24.8 gross HP**, **19.5 PTO HP**, **680 lb 3-point lift capacity at 24" behind pin**, **1,521 lb tractor weight with ROPS**. citeturn29view0turn30view0  
- **Mahindra eMax 25**: Mahindra’s current site groups eMax series in **19.4–24 hp** and highlights loader lift capacity ranges for the series; a separate industry publication article lists **900 lb loader lift capacity** and **1,320 lb 3-point lift capacity** for eMax 25 HST-era models. citeturn21view0turn18search26  

### Commercial 60"+ zero-turn mowers

Commercial zero-turn mowers exist specifically to maximize mowing productivity and cut quality, and manufacturers publish commercial warranties with hour caps consistent with contractor usage:

- **John Deere Z900-series example**: the Z950R page describes **M Series 3-year/1200-hour bumper-to-bumper** and **R Series 3-year/1500-hour bumper-to-bumper**, both with “no hour limitation” during the first 24 months, and lists deck size options including 60". citeturn32search0  
- **Exmark Lazer Z X-Series** model pages show a **5-year / 1500-hour limited warranty** with “no hour limit the first 2 years.” citeturn18search11  
- **Scag Turf Tiger II**: Scag publishes MSRP-style list prices by configuration on its product page and publishes a commercial warranty policy framework (e.g., 2-year commercial machine warranty for certain series). citeturn32search15turn32search7

## Pricing, incentives, used market snapshot, and lease-rental alternatives

### New pricing for tractor + loader + 60" deck packages

“MSRP” transparency varies by brand and by dealer. Kubota publishes “MSRP as low as” by model on the BX series page; some dealers publish full package cash prices and/or itemized component pricing. citeturn28view0turn17view0turn0search28  

| Equipment | Source type | Price elements captured | Published price |
|---|---|---|---:|
| JD 1025R base tractor | Dealer build tool (MSRP + dealer price) | MSRP $18,400; dealer price $17,795 citeturn11search16 | $17,795 (dealer “our price”) |

Interpretation:  
- For **John Deere 1025R** “load + mow” setups, a realistic new package price in this region is **high-$20Ks** once loader and 60" deck are included (and many dealers bundle additional implements, which can obscure the pure “tractor+loader+deck” figure). citeturn17view0turn15search10turn16search0  
- For **Kubota BX2380/BX2680**, published dealer package quotes cluster in the **low-to-mid $20Ks** for tractor+loader+60" deck configurations, with the BX2680 typically pricing above the BX2380. citeturn0search28turn1search18turn28view0  
- For **Mahindra eMax 25**, published pricing located in sources used here was clearer for tractor+loader than for a complete 60" mid-mount deck package; promotions and warranty appear competitive, but local dealer support is a gating factor for a commercial operation. citeturn1search24turn21view0turn20view0

### Warranty terms relevant to commercial use

Warranty affects downtime risk, repair liability, and resale value. The most decision-relevant distinction in the sources is the “commercial use” category:

- Kubota BX series warranty chart for units purchased after 1/1/2025 shows **Basic 24 months / 1500 hours** and **Limited Powertrain 36 months / 2000 hours** under “Commercial Use.” citeturn19view0  
- Mahindra describes a **7-year limited powertrain warranty** for “4500 series and lower models, such as eMax,” subject to a **3,000-hour rule**, and a separate Mahindra policy document enumerates coverage periods by series and usage. citeturn20view0turn18search6  
- John Deere Z900 series commercial mower page describes **3-year bumper-to-bumper warranties** with hour caps and “no hour limitation” in the first 24 months. citeturn32search0  
- Scag’s warranty policy page describes a **2-year commercial machine warranty** for Turf Tiger II/Cheetah/Tiger Cat II/Patriot classes. citeturn32search7  
- Exmark Lazer Z X-Series pages describe **5-year/1500-hour** commercial warranty with no hour cap in first 2 years. citeturn18search11  

### Used market snapshot

The request specifies 2–5 year units with 200–500 hours, focusing on listings from entity["company","Facebook Marketplace","classified marketplace platform"], entity["company","Craigslist","classified listings website"], entity["company","Equipment Trader","equipment marketplace"], and entity["company","Machinery Pete","farm equipment listings and data site"] in the Cincinnati/Dayton area. In the sources captured within the tool-call limit for this report, the most directly usable, location-relevant “near Cincinnati” example is a used 1025R listing at a local dealer location and multiple Ohio-region Craigslist references. citeturn11search12turn27search0turn25search10  

A small sample of captured listings (not exhaustive):

Condition and hours patterns seen in the limited captured examples:
- Sub-compact tractors can accumulate **hundreds of hours** while still being described as “fully loaded,” “serviced,” and “needs nothing,” implying that cosmetic condition and maintenance records matter as much as hours. citeturn27search0  
- A dealer-listed 2021 1025R at ~$19.5K suggests that late-model used prices can remain high relative to new package totals, consistent with “high resale” narratives in the sub-compact category (hours would determine how strong that holds in Cincinnati specifically). citeturn11search12turn17view0  

### Lease and rental options

#### Short-term rentals

Published rental rates make renting viable for episodic tractor needs and as a downtime hedge:

- Compact tractors (27–35 HP 4WD) at one rental source show **$135/day and $540/week**, with the note: “Tractor rental rate is the same with or without front end loader.” citeturn31search0  
- A “John Deere 1025R Compact Utility Tractor w/ Loader & Backhoe” rental listing shows **$203/day, $728/week, $2,080/month** (location-limited per the listing). citeturn31search5  
- 60" zero-turn mower rentals: examples include **$119.99/day, $439.99/week** for a “60" Zero Turn Mower,” and another example of **$110/day, $425/week, $1,125/month** for “Zero Turn 60".” citeturn31search4turn31search12  

#### Lease structures (36–60 months) and rent-to-own

Specific 36–60 month published lease payment factors were not broadly available in the sources captured, but one manufacturer financing channel provides a clear **commercial lease structure**:

- Exmark publishes a “stated purchase option lease structure” through Western Equipment Finance with **24 or 36 month terms** and selectable **annual hour options (400/600/750/1200)**. citeturn31search13  

Dealer promotions can resemble rent-to-own when paired with 0% financing and high resale values, but in practice the decision should be driven by utilization and service criticality, not merely monthly payment.

#### When renting makes sense

Renting tends to make economic and operational sense when:

- Tractor work is **episodic** (spring mulch movement, one-off grading, occasional aeration seeding, storm cleanup) and you can schedule it into 1–3 day bursts, making daily/weekly rate efficiency strong. citeturn31search0turn31search5  
- You want to **de-risk downtime** on the revenue-critical mower by having a clear rental fallback rate and availability plan. citeturn31search4turn31search12  
- You are still validating client density and route efficiency; an owned tractor that sits idle is an expensive form of optionality.

## Total cost of ownership analysis

### Modeling approach and assumptions

The TCO tables below use a two-layer approach:

- **Equipment-only TCO**: purchase price + operating costs (fuel, maintenance, insurance, downtime rentals) – resale value.  
- **Economic TCO (adds time)**: equipment-only TCO + value of operator mowing time. For a commercial startup, this “time layer” often dominates.

Assumptions used (editable, not sourced):
- Workload baseline: 20 clients × 1.5 mowable acres × 28 weeks = 840 acre-cuts/year.
- Productivity: 60" commercial zero-turn 3.5 acres/hr; 60" tractor MMM 2.0 acres/hr.
- Fuel prices: gasoline $3.25/gal; diesel $3.90/gal.
- Fuel burn rates: zero-turn 1.2 gal/hr; tractor 0.5 gal/hr.
- Maintenance: zero-turn $2.50/hr + $250/yr fixed; tractor $1.50/hr + $200/yr fixed (Mahindra slightly higher).
- Insurance: 2.5% of purchase price per year (equipment policy).
- Downtime contingency: zero-turn rents 2 days/year at ~$120/day (published 60" ZTR daily rental examples); tractor rents 3 days/year at ~$203/day (published compact tractor rental example). citeturn31search4turn31search12turn31search5  
- Resale factors (assumptions): tractors retain 60–65% at 5 years; zero-turn retains ~45% at 5 years.

Where purchase prices are sourced, the table references the specific dealer/manufacturer pages used; where a complete tractor+deck price was not published, a clearly labeled estimate is used.

### Adding time value changes the decision

If the same acreage is mowed using a tractor MMM instead of a commercial zero-turn, modeled mowing time rises from ~240 hours/year to ~420 hours/year in the baseline workload (assumption). At an assumed $30/hour “loaded value of operator time,” that is ~$5,400/year of time difference.

A simplified 5-year “economic” view:

| Scenario | 5-year equipment-only (incl. rentals where relevant) | Mowing hours/year (modeled) | 5-year time value (@$30/hr) | 5-year economic total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| JD 1025R package as primary mower | $25,070 | 420 | $63,000 | $88,070 |
| Kubota BX2380 package as primary mower | $23,527 | 420 | $63,000 | $86,527 |
| Kubota BX2680 package as primary mower | $25,172 | 420 | $63,000 | $88,172 |
| Mahindra eMax 25 package as primary mower | $30,991 | 420 | $63,000 | $93,991 |
| Scag 61" zero-turn + rent tractor as needed | $35,172 | 240 | $36,000 | $71,172 |

This is the core business insight: for a mowing-heavy startup, **mowing throughput is often worth more than small differences in tractor package pricing**. That is why many commercial operators deploy a commercial zero-turn as the primary mower and use tractors for non-mowing tasks.

## Dealer and service ecosystem around Liberty Township

Within a 1-hour operational radius, the most decision-relevant “dealer quality” attributes for a commercial mowing startup are: (1) ability to turn repairs quickly in-season, (2) stocked common parts (belts, spindles, blades, hydro filters), (3) willingness to support commercial customers, and (4) loaner/demo programs or rental backstops for downtime.

Captured in sources for this report:

- entity["local_business","Koenig Equipment","Lebanon, OH, US"] publishes multiple nearby Ohio locations including **Lebanon** and **Amelia** and actively markets bundled compact tractor packages (including 1025R mower/loader packages) and financing programs through its site. citeturn17view0turn11search16  
- entity["local_business","Baxla Tractor Sales","Seaman, OH, US"] is described in its dealer profile as supporting brands including Kubota and Exmark, and listings show BX2380 and BX2680 pricing. citeturn4search0turn1search16  

The user-specified dealer list included “Messick’s Eaton OH, Clinch Valley Equipment, Tri-County Equipment Mt. Orab OH.” Captured evidence did not cleanly validate those exact name/location pairings as a single coherent “within 1 hour” dealer set within the tool-call limit:

- “Messick’s” references captured in search results correspond to the well-known Messick’s operation outside Ohio, and Eaton, OH results surfaced other equipment businesses (e.g., a local Eaton dealer name in search results) rather than a clearly verified “Messick’s Eaton” storefront in the captured snippets. citeturn6search1turn6search2  
- A “Tri-County Equipment” name surfaced in web results as a dealership group outside Ohio; a “Tri-County Power Equipment” branded Kubota dealer also surfaced, but the exact “Mt. Orab Tri-County Equipment” match was not confirmed in the captured evidence. citeturn6search0turn7search0turn7search1  
- “Clinch Valley Equipment” location confirmation near Cincinnati was not captured in the sources included within the remaining tool calls. citeturn7search2  

Practical implication: for final selection, the near-term highest leverage step is to shortlist the 2–3 closest high-service-capacity dealers for each brand (John Deere, Kubota, mower brand) and explicitly score them on turnaround time, pickup/delivery, and in-season parts availability.

## Recommended acquisition strategy, contingency plan, and decision tools

### Best-fit acquisition strategy for Year 1 mowing clients

Given the Year 1 business objective (15–25 estate mowing clients), the highest-confidence strategy is:

- Acquire a **commercial 60–61" zero-turn mower** as the primary production machine, chosen based on:  
  - Warranty fit for commercial hours (e.g., John Deere Z900 bumper-to-bumper structure or Exmark Lazer Z X-Series published hour-cap warranty). citeturn32search0turn18search11  
  - Dealer proximity and service speed.  
  - Quality-of-cut platform reputation and parts pipeline (belts, spindles, blades, caster parts).

- Use **compact tractor rentals** for loader/implement work until utilization justifies purchase. Published daily/weekly tractor rentals (including loader-included pricing) make this economically defensible for episodic needs. citeturn31search0turn31search5  

- Reassess after the first mowing season with real utilization data:
  - If you are consistently doing loader work (mulch installs, material handling, grading) > ~2 days/month during the season, or if you expand into snow management, a sub-compact tractor becomes “owned capacity” rather than an occasional rental.
  - At that point, consider either (a) a used late-model sub-compact tractor package with verifiable service history, or (b) a new tractor driven by the strongest promotional finance program and local service support.

### Contingency planning

Downtime risk is existential in a mowing-route startup. The contingency plan should treat the mower as a revenue engine:

- Identify in advance which rental provider can supply a 60" zero-turn on short notice and what trailer requirements apply (one rental listing explicitly notes trailer size needs). citeturn31search4turn31search12  
- For tractor tasks, maintain a short list of rental sources and confirm whether loaders are included and what the minimum rental period is. citeturn31search0turn31search5  

### Mermaid timeline for the acquisition decision

    title Acquisition timeline for Stone & Salt equipment (Year 1)
    Feb 2026 : Define service mix (mowing-first vs multi-service) and trailer/tow constraints
    Feb 2026 : Get 2–3 written dealer quotes per category (ZTR, tractor package) and confirm service lead times
    Mar 2026 : Acquire primary commercial zero-turn mower; set up preventive maintenance kit and spare blades
    Mar 2026 : Establish rental accounts for compact tractor and backup zero-turn
    Apr 2026 : Start mowing season; track machine hours, downtime incidents, and add-on service demand
    Jul 2026 : Mid-season review; decide whether tractor ownership is justified by utilization
    Oct 2026 : End-season evaluation; update 12-month acquisition plan (buy used vs buy new vs continue renting)

### Why this strategy is the best fit for 15–25 mowing clients

- **Mowing productivity dominates economics**: a commercial zero-turn mower is structurally designed for route mowing and backed by commercial warranty frameworks with hour caps appropriate for contractors. citeturn32search0turn18search11turn32search7  
- **Rentals provide flexibility**: published rates for compact tractors and 60" zero-turn rentals allow Stone & Salt to “buy the revenue tool” and “rent the occasional capability,” reducing idle capital. citeturn31search0turn31search4turn31search5  
- **Tractors become a second-machine story**: sub-compact tractor packages (1025R, BX2380/BX2680, eMax 25) are compelling once you add consistent loader/implement services, but as primary mowing machines they tend to increase hours and compress weekly schedule capacity.

If Stone & Salt decides to buy a tractor in Year 1 anyway (for strategic differentiation via loader services), the decision should be driven less by the last $1–2K of package pricing and more by: (1) commercial warranty coverage specifics, (2) proximity and reputation of the servicing dealer, and (3) whether promotional finance terms match cash-flow needs. Kubota’s commercial-use powertrain duration is explicitly shorter than residential in the warranty chart, while Mahindra’s powertrain warranty messaging and financing terms are unusually long. citeturn19view0turn21view0turn20view0

# Stone & Salt Financial Model
## Commercial-Primary Year 1 Projections | February 15, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This financial model projects Stone & Salt's path to $325,000 in Year 1 revenue under a commercial-primary positioning strategy. The model accounts for the critical 3-6 month commercial sales cycle, incorporates the signed Mike's Carwash contract as anchor revenue, and uses validated pricing from PRICING_BENCHMARKS.md throughout.

**Key findings:**
- Break-even month: Month 7 (September 2026)
- Cash flow positive: Month 8 (October 2026)
- Working capital required: $38,000-$52,000
- Total startup capital needed: $55,000-$78,000 (conservative-to-buffer)
- Year 1 net profit (conservative): $42,500-$58,000

**Critical assumption:** The 3-6 month commercial sales cycle means months 1-4 will operate at a loss. Hardscape projects and residential maintenance bridge the gap. Mike's Carwash provides immediate recurring revenue.

## 1. Revenue Model: Commercial-Primary Path to $325K

### 1A. Quarterly Revenue Breakdown

| Quarter | Months | Revenue | Cumulative | Key Activities |
|---------|--------|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Q1** (Mar-May) | 1-3 | $38,500 | $38,500 | Mike's Carwash active, 1 hardscape project, 5-8 residential maint., 50+ PM conversations, 5-10 proposals sent |
| **Q2** (Jun-Aug) | 4-6 | $72,000 | $110,500 | 2-3 commercial contracts close, 2 hardscape projects, residential maintenance grows to 10-12 |
| **Q3** (Sep-Nov) | 7-9 | $102,000 | $212,500 | 5-6 commercial grounds active, snow contracts signed (Oct), 1-2 hardscape projects |
| **Q4** (Dec-Feb) | 10-12 | $112,500 | $325,000 | 6-8 commercial grounds + 4-6 snow contracts active, snow season begins |
| **TOTAL** | | **$325,000** | | |

**Quarter-by-quarter logic:**

**Q1 ($38,500):** The leanest quarter. Mike's Carwash provides ~$1,500/month grounds revenue. One hardscape project ($30K deposit = $15K received in Q1). Residential maintenance just starting (5-8 accounts at $350/mo avg). The bulk of this quarter is spent on outreach and proposals — planting seeds that won't close until Q2-Q3.

**Q2 ($72,000):** First commercial contracts start closing from Q1 outreach. Two hardscape projects generate cash. Residential base grows. This is the inflection quarter where revenue starts building momentum.

**Q3 ($102,000):** Commercial grounds portfolio hits 5-6 contracts. Snow contracts get signed for upcoming season (Oct-Mar). One to two more hardscape projects. Revenue ramp accelerates.

**Q4 ($112,500):** Full commercial portfolio active. Snow season launches with 4-6 contracts. Highest revenue quarter due to snow + grounds combined.

| **December** | 10 | $39,000 | $251,500 | 7 commercial grounds ($12,000). 5-6 snow contracts ($14,000). Maint reduced to 8 winter ($2,800). |
| **January** | 11 | $37,500 | $289,000 | 7 commercial grounds ($12,000). Snow full swing ($14,500). Maint winter 8 ($2,800). |
| **February** | 12 | $36,000 | $325,000 | 8 commercial grounds ($13,500). Snow contracts ($12,500). Maint winter 8 ($2,800). Renewals starting. |

**Note on ramp realism:** Months 1-3 average $12,833/month. Months 4-6 average $24,000/month. Months 7-9 average $34,000/month. Months 10-12 average $37,500/month. This hockey-stick pattern is expected given the commercial sales cycle.

### 1C. Revenue Mix (Year 1)

| Revenue Source | % of Total | Amount | Units Needed | Avg Value | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Commercial grounds maintenance** | 37% | $120,000 | 6-8 contracts | $15,000-$20,000/yr avg ($1,500/mo) | Ramps from 1 (Mike's) to 8 over 12 months |
| **Commercial snow removal** | 20% | $65,000 | 4-6 contracts | $10,000-$15,000/season avg | Seasonal Oct-Mar, includes Mike's |
| **Residential hardscape** | 28% | $91,000 | 4-6 projects | $30,000-$35,000 avg (gross revenue after materials) | Bridge revenue during commercial sales cycle |
| **Residential maintenance** | 15% | $49,000 | 10-15 accounts | $350/mo avg, seasonal reduction in winter | Route density filler |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | **$325,000** | | | |

**Revenue source rationale:**

- **Commercial grounds ($120K):** The core of the business model. Mike's Carwash starts Month 1. Additional contracts close on a rolling basis: 1 in Month 3, 1 in Month 5, 2 in Month 7, 1 in Month 9, 1 in Month 11. Average contract $15K-$20K/year = $1,250-$1,667/month. Using midpoint $1,500/month.

- **Commercial snow ($65K):** Includes Mike's Carwash snow + 3-5 additional commercial snow contracts. Contracts signed Sept-Oct, service Nov-Mar. Average $10,000-$15,000/season. Cincinnati averages 15-23 inches, so this is supplementary -- NOT the backbone. Per-push overflow events add to seasonal contract base.

- **Residential hardscape ($91K):** 4-6 projects at $25K-$35K minimum ($30K avg). This is gross project revenue. Payments: 50% deposit / 50% completion. Critical for cash flow during months 1-6 when commercial pipeline is building. Projects sourced from Home & Garden Show (Feb 20-22), Google LSA, and referrals.

- **Residential maintenance ($49K):** 10-15 accounts at $300-$600/month ($350 avg). Grows from 5 accounts in Month 1 to 12-15 by Month 6. Reduces to 8 in winter months. Pure route density play -- not a growth driver, but steady cash.

## 2. Cash Flow Projection with Sales Cycle Impact

### 2A. Monthly Operating Expenses

| Expense Category | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Notes |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Partner draws** | $6,000 | $72,000 | $3,000/partner. Lean months 1-4, increases with revenue |

### 2B. Monthly Cash Flow Table

| Month | Revenue | Fixed Expenses | Materials | Partner Draws | Total Expenses | Net Cash Flow | Cumulative Cash |
|-------|---------|---------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|

### 2C. Cash Flow Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Months operating at a loss** | Months 1-2 (March-April) | Revenue insufficient to cover fixed costs + draws |
| **Break-even month** | Month 3 (May) | First month with positive net cash flow |
| **Cumulative break-even** | Month 5 (July) | Cumulative cash turns positive |
| **Maximum cash deficit** | -$7,500 | Reached in Month 2 (April) |
| **Working capital required** | $38,000-$52,000 | Covers startup costs + operating losses + 2-month reserve |
| **Year-end retained earnings** | $88,500 | Before year-end adjustments and taxes |

### 2D. Cash Flow Assumptions

**Revenue timing:**
- Commercial grounds contracts: Billed monthly, net-30 payment terms. Assume 15-day average collection.
- Hardscape projects: 50% deposit at signing, 50% on completion. Projects average 3-4 weeks.
- Snow contracts: Seasonal contract billed monthly Oct-Mar (1/6 of annual). Per-push billed within 48 hours.
- Residential maintenance: Billed monthly, payment on receipt.
- Mike's Carwash: Active from Month 1. Assumed $1,500/month grounds + $10,000 snow season ($1,667/mo Oct-Mar).

**Expense timing:**
- Insurance: Paid quarterly ($3,000/quarter) -- shown as monthly amortization.
- Equipment: $16,500 tractor financed. $450/month for 36 months at 0% (Kubota promo).
- Materials: Purchased per-project (hardscape) or in bulk seasonal (salt). Modeled at 25-30% of hardscape revenue, 15% of maintenance revenue, variable for snow.
- Partner draws: Partners take minimum viable draws months 1-3, increasing as revenue supports. Draws are NOT salaries -- partners receive profit distribution at year end.

**Collections risk:** Commercial clients typically pay net-30. Model assumes 15-day average. A 30-day delay would shift the cash flow negative zone by one month. Hardscape deposits mitigate this risk because 50% is collected before work begins.

## 3. Unit Economics by Service Line

### 3A. Commercial Grounds Maintenance (Annual Contract)

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Average contract value** | $18,000/year | $1,500/month x 12 months |
| **Monthly revenue** | $1,500 | Range: $1,000-$5,000/mo depending on property size |
| **Labor cost** | 40% ($7,200/yr) | 2-person crew, ~4 hrs/week per property at $22/hr |
| **Materials** | 10% ($1,800/yr) | Fertilizer, mulch, seed, plants |
| **Equipment/overhead** | 15% ($2,700/yr) | Fuel, wear, insurance allocation, CRM |
| **Gross profit** | **35% ($6,300/yr)** | Per contract |
| **Annual gross profit per contract** | **$6,300** | |
| **Monthly gross profit per contract** | **$525** | |

**Notes:** The 35% margin aligns with the 30% maintenance target from PRICING_BENCHMARKS.md, with upside because commercial properties have lower travel time per dollar of revenue than residential (larger lots, less mobilization).

With 8 contracts by year-end: **$50,400 gross profit** from commercial grounds alone.

---

### 3B. Commercial Snow Removal (Seasonal Contract)

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Average contract value** | $12,000/season | Range: $5,000-$25,000/season |
| **Monthly revenue (Oct-Mar)** | $2,000 | Contract billed over 6 months |
| **Labor cost** | 25% ($3,000/season) | On-call + deployment (fewer hours than grounds) |
| **Salt/materials (normal pricing)** | 20% ($2,400/season) | At $75/ton bulk rate |
| **Salt/materials (volatile pricing)** | 30% ($3,600/season) | At $140/ton spot rate |
| **Equipment** | 10% ($1,200/season) | Plow wear, fuel, Bobcat hours |
| **Gross profit (normal salt)** | **45% ($5,400/season)** | When salt at $75/ton |
| **Gross profit (volatile salt)** | **35% ($4,200/season)** | When salt at $140/ton |

**Salt price sensitivity (per contract):**

| Salt Price | Material Cost | Gross Margin | Gross Profit |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| $67/ton (DOT rate) | $1,800 | 48% | $5,760 |
| $75/ton (historical avg) | $2,100 | 45% | $5,400 |
| $100/ton (moderate increase) | $2,800 | 40% | $4,800 |
| $140/ton (spot rate) | $3,600 | 35% | $4,200 |

**Critical mitigation:** Every snow contract MUST include a salt surcharge clause that passes through material cost increases above $85/ton. This protects margins in the $100-$140+ range. Without this clause, the $140/ton scenario reduces snow from a 45% margin business to 35%, costing $1,200/contract.

With 5 contracts at $12K avg: **$21,000-$27,000 gross profit** from commercial snow (depending on salt prices).

---

### 3C. Hardscape Installation (Residential Projects)

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Average project value** | $30,000 | Range: $25,000-$65,000 (minimum $25K) |
| **Materials** | 35% ($10,500) | Belgard pavers $3.83/sf, base materials, edging. All-in paver install $21-28/sf |
| **Labor** | 20% ($6,000) | 2-3 person crew, 2-3 weeks per project |
| **Equipment** | 5% ($1,500) | Bobcat, compactor, transport |
| **Gross profit** | **40% ($12,000)** | Per project |
| **Annual gross profit (5 projects)** | **$60,000** | |

**Hardscape material cost detail:**
- Belgard LaFitt paver: $3.83/sf (verified)
- #57 limestone base: $38.50/ton
- Polymeric sand: ~$0.40/sf
- All-in install cost to homeowner: $21-28/sf
- Stone & Salt targets $24-35/sf (15-25% premium positioning)

**Payment schedule:** 50% deposit ($15,000) at contract signing, 50% ($15,000) on completion. This front-loads cash -- critical for months 1-6 when commercial revenue is still building.

With 5 projects across the year: **$60,000 gross profit** from hardscape.

---

### 3D. Residential Maintenance

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Average monthly revenue** | $350/month | Range: $300-$600/month |
| **Annual value per account** | $3,150 | 9 active months (reduced winter) |
| **Labor** | 50% ($1,575/yr) | Higher percentage -- smaller lots, more drive time |
| **Materials** | 10% ($315/yr) | Fertilizer, mulch |
| **Equipment/overhead** | 10% ($315/yr) | Mower wear, fuel |
| **Gross profit** | **30% ($945/yr)** | Per account |

**Note:** Residential maintenance runs the lowest margin of all service lines. Its value is route density (filling time between commercial stops) and upsell potential (snow, hardscape). Do not over-invest in residential growth at the expense of commercial acquisition.

With 12 accounts average across the year: **$11,340 gross profit** from residential maintenance.

---

### 3E. Customer Lifetime Value (Commercial)

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Combined annual value (grounds + snow)** | $30,000 | $18,000 grounds + $12,000 snow |
| **Annual gross profit** | $11,700 | $6,300 grounds + $5,400 snow |
| **Retention rate** | 90% | Industry standard for commercial |
| **Average tenure** | 7 years | 1 / (1 - 0.90) = 10 theoretical, conservatively 7 |
| **5-year revenue** | $135,000 | $30K x 4.095 (discount factor at 90% retention) |
| **5-year gross profit** | $52,650 | $11,700 x 4.5 (retention-adjusted) |
| **Lifetime value (7-year)** | $172,000 | Revenue over average tenure, retention-adjusted |

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**

| Acquisition Channel | CAC | LTV | LTV:CAC Ratio |
|---------------------|-----|-----|---------------|
| Google LSA | $125-$165 | $172,000 | **1,042:1 to 1,376:1** |
| Direct outreach | $50-$100 | $172,000 | **1,720:1 to 3,440:1** |
| Referral | $0-$500 | $172,000 | **344:1+** |
| Google PPC | $330-$880 | $172,000 | **195:1 to 521:1** |

**Insight:** Commercial customer LTV is extraordinary. Even the most expensive acquisition channel (Google PPC at $880 CAC) yields a 195:1 LTV:CAC ratio. This means virtually any channel that produces commercial leads is worth investing in. The economics heavily favor aggressive commercial customer acquisition spending.

**However, the real bottleneck is not CAC -- it is the 3-6 month sales cycle.** Money alone does not accelerate commercial sales. Relationship-building, references, and proposal quality determine close rate.

**Recommendation:** Target the **Buffer scenario at $67,000**. This provides enough cushion for the lean months (1-4) without over-capitalizing. The tractor can be financed at 0% (Kubota promo), which reduces the upfront cash need by ~$16,500, bringing the cash-out-of-pocket to approximately **$50,000-$51,000**.

**If financing the tractor:**

| Scenario | Cash Required (Day 1) | Financed | Monthly Payment |

## 5. Risk Assessment & Sensitivity Analysis

### 5A. High Risk: 3-6 Month Commercial Sales Cycle

**Impact:** The single biggest threat to Year 1 cash flow. Commercial property managers operate on annual budget cycles. Decision-making involves RFP processes, board approvals, and multi-vendor evaluation. Even a warm lead can take 90-180 days from first conversation to signed contract.

**Cash flow impact:** If the average commercial contract takes 5 months to close (from first contact to first revenue), outreach starting March 1 means first new commercial revenue arrives August at earliest. Mike's Carwash bridges months 1-7, but total commercial revenue is backloaded to Q3-Q4.

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. **Mike's Carwash as anchor:** Already signed. Provides $18,000-$28,000/year (grounds + snow) and -- more importantly -- serves as a reference account for every subsequent proposal.
2. **Hardscape as bridge revenue:** 4-6 residential hardscape projects generate $91,000 with faster sales cycles (2-4 weeks from lead to deposit). This fills the Q1-Q2 cash gap.
3. **Start outreach immediately:** Target 50 property manager conversations by March 15 (per CONCEPT-BRIEF.md success conditions). Volume of conversations compresses the sales cycle.
4. **Budget season targeting:** Q4 is when commercial PMs set next year's budgets. Proposals sent in Oct-Nov position for January starts -- meaning Year 2 commercial pipeline starts building in Year 1 Q3.
5. **Proposal speed advantage:** 48-72 hour proposal turnaround (vs. competitors' 1-2 weeks) compresses the decision timeline.

### 5B. Medium Risk: Salt Price Volatility

**Impact:** Cincinnati river terminal closures removed 200,000+ tons of bulk salt capacity. Cargill exited the local market. Salt prices have swung from $67/ton (DOT rate) to $140+/ton on spot markets. A severe winter with tight supply could push prices even higher.

**Financial impact on a $12,000 snow contract:**

| Salt Price | Material Cost | Margin | Profit Loss vs. Baseline |
|-----------|---------------|--------|--------------------------|
| $67/ton (DOT) | $1,800 | 48% | +$300 (baseline+) |
| $75/ton (baseline) | $2,100 | 45% | $0 |
| $100/ton | $2,800 | 40% | -$700 |
| $140/ton | $3,600 | 35% | -$1,500 |
| $175/ton (worst case) | $4,400 | 28% | -$2,300 |

**Impact across 5 snow contracts:** At $140/ton, total profit loss = $7,500 (vs. $75/ton baseline). At $175/ton worst case, loss = $11,500.

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. **Salt surcharge clause in every contract:** "Material costs based on $85/ton bulk rate. Actual costs exceeding $85/ton will be passed through at cost plus 10% handling." This is standard industry practice.
2. **Pre-season bulk purchase:** Buy salt in August-September at pre-season rates. Lock in 20-30 tons before demand spikes.
3. **Diversify suppliers:** Build relationships with 2-3 salt suppliers. The DOT rate ($67/ton) is available to qualified buyers.
4. **Liquid brine alternative:** Pre-treating with brine reduces bulk salt usage by 30-40%. Investment in a brine tank ($1,500-$3,000) pays for itself if salt exceeds $120/ton.

### 5C. Medium Risk: Labor Shortage

**Impact:** 80% of landscape operators report hiring challenges (per research). As Stone & Salt grows past 2-partner capacity (likely Month 4-6), hiring reliable crew members becomes critical.

**Financial impact:** Unable to hire = unable to serve additional contracts = revenue cap. If crew hiring delays by 2 months, Q3-Q4 revenue could be reduced by $20,000-$30,000 as contracts are turned away or delayed.

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. **Premium wages:** Pay $18-$22/hour (vs. industry $14-$17). This costs $3,000-$5,000/year more per employee but dramatically improves retention and candidate quality.
2. **Year-round employment:** Offer year-round positions (grounds spring-fall, snow winter). This is the #1 differentiator in hiring -- most landscape companies lay off crews in November.
3. **Partner-first model:** Partners perform all work months 1-4. First hire in Month 5. This delays the labor risk until revenue supports the investment.
4. **Referral bonus:** $500 per hired referral that stays 90 days.

**Hiring timeline:**

| Month | Headcount | Role | Monthly Labor Cost |
|-------|-----------|------|--------------------|
| 1-4 | 2 (partners) | All roles | $0 (partner draws) |
| 5-6 | 3 | First crew member | $3,500 |
| 7-9 | 4 | Second crew member | $7,000 |
| 10-12 | 4-5 | Seasonal snow help | $7,000-$10,500 |

---

### 5D. Low Risk: Cincinnati Weather (Snow)

**Impact:** Cincinnati averages only 15-23 inches of snow per year (below the national average of 28 inches). Some winters bring 10 inches; rare winters bring 30+. Building a business model on snow revenue in Cincinnati is structurally unreliable.

**Financial impact of low-snow winter:**

| Snowfall | Snow Revenue (seasonal contracts) | Snow Revenue (per-push overflow) | Total Snow Revenue |
|----------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| 10" (mild winter) | $65,000 (contracts pay regardless) | $2,000 | $67,000 |
| 18" (average) | $65,000 | $8,000 | $73,000 |
| 25" (above average) | $65,000 | $15,000 | $80,000 |

**Key insight:** Seasonal contracts pay the same regardless of snowfall. This is why the model uses seasonal contracts as the primary snow revenue structure. Per-push is upside only. In a mild winter, Stone & Salt still collects $65,000 in seasonal contract revenue. In a heavy winter, per-push overflow adds $8,000-$15,000.

**Mitigation:** Snow is already positioned as supplementary (20% of revenue). The model does NOT depend on above-average snowfall. Even zero snow revenue leaves $260,000 in grounds, hardscape, and maintenance -- enough to cover all expenses and provide modest partner income.

### 5E. Sensitivity Analysis: Contract Count Scenarios

| Scenario | Commercial Grounds | Commercial Snow | Hardscape Projects | Resi. Maint. | Total Revenue | Total Gross Profit | Partner Income (each) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Worst Case** | 4 contracts | 3 contracts | 3 projects | 8 accounts | $215,000 | $65,000 | $20,000 |
| **Conservative** | 6 contracts | 4 contracts | 4 projects | 10 accounts | $275,000 | $82,000 | $28,000 |
| **Target (Base)** | 8 contracts | 5 contracts | 5 projects | 12 accounts | $325,000 | $100,000 | $37,000 |
| **Moderate** | 10 contracts | 6 contracts | 6 projects | 15 accounts | $410,000 | $140,000 | $55,000 |
| **Strong** | 12 contracts | 8 contracts | 6 projects | 15 accounts | $490,000 | $175,000 | $72,000 |

**Revenue detail by scenario:**

| Scenario | Grounds Rev. | Snow Rev. | Hardscape Rev. | Maint Rev. | TOTAL |
|----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Worst Case | $60,000 | $36,000 | $90,000 | $29,000 | $215,000 |
| Conservative | $90,000 | $48,000 | $96,000 | $41,000 | $275,000 |
| Target (Base) | $120,000 | $65,000 | $91,000 | $49,000 | $325,000 |
| Moderate | $165,000 | $78,000 | $108,000 | $59,000 | $410,000 |
| Strong | $200,000 | $104,000 | $108,000 | $59,000 | $471,000 |

**Critical threshold:** The "Worst Case" scenario ($215K) still covers all fixed expenses ($126K) and provides $65K in gross profit. After partner draws ($60K minimum), this leaves only $5,000 in retained earnings -- survivable but uncomfortable. This is the floor.

---

### 5F. Key Assumptions That Must Hold

| # | Assumption | Confidence | What Breaks If Wrong |
|---|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Win 6-8 commercial grounds contracts by end of Year 1 | MEDIUM | Revenue falls to $215K-$275K range. Survivable but lean. |
| 2 | Close rate on commercial proposals > 15% | MEDIUM | Need to send 40-55 proposals to hit 6-8 contracts. If close rate is 10%, need 60-80 proposals. |
| 3 | Mike's Carwash contract value is $1,500/mo grounds + $10K snow season | HIGH | Already signed. Only risk is if contract is cancelled. |
| 4 | 90% client retention rate | HIGH | Industry standard. First-year churn could be higher as service is proven. |
| 5 | Equipment acquired by March 1 | MEDIUM | Without tractor, cannot service large commercial lots. Delays push revenue start to April-May. |
| 6 | Hardscape projects available to bridge cash flow | MEDIUM | Depends on Home & Garden Show leads and Google LSA. 4-6 projects is conservative for Cincinnati market. |
| 7 | Partner draws can stay at $2,500-$3,500/mo | HIGH | Both partners have other income or savings. If not, draws increase and profit decreases. |
| 8 | Salt surcharge clause accepted by clients | HIGH | Industry standard. Clients who refuse are red flags. |
| 9 | Insurance obtained at $3,000-$4,500/year for GL | HIGH | Standard rate for new landscaping LLC with commercial coverage. |
| 10 | No major equipment failures in Year 1 | MEDIUM | Existing trucks and Bobcat are maintained. New (used) tractor has risk. Budget $2,000 contingency. |

## 6. Decision Metrics

### 6A. Go/No-Go Indicators (Monthly Checkpoints)

| Checkpoint | Month | Target | Measurement | Status if Missed |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Outreach volume** | 1 (March) | 50+ property manager conversations initiated | CRM tracking | YELLOW -- double outreach effort in April |
| **Proposals sent** | 3 (May) | At least 5 commercial proposals sent | Proposal tracker | YELLOW -- reassess messaging, consider reducing price |
| **First new contract** | 4 (June) | At least 1 new commercial contract (beyond Mike's) | Signed contract | ORANGE -- if zero by Month 4, bridge with more hardscape |
| **Revenue pace** | 6 (August) | $110K+ cumulative revenue | Bookkeeping | ORANGE -- on pace for $220K annual, not $325K |
| **Commercial portfolio** | 6 (August) | At least 3 total commercial contracts (including Mike's) | Signed contracts | RED -- commercial model not validating. Pivot to residential-heavy. |
| **Snow contracts** | 8 (October) | At least 4 snow contracts signed for winter | Signed contracts | YELLOW -- still time to sign late-season contracts |
| **Revenue pace** | 9 (November) | $200K+ cumulative revenue | Bookkeeping | GREEN if met. RED if under $160K. |
| **Full portfolio** | 12 (February) | 6-8 commercial grounds + 4-6 snow + positive cash flow | Full review | Year 1 assessment. Set Year 2 targets. |

### 6B. Kill Criteria

These are the conditions under which the commercial-primary model should be abandoned or fundamentally restructured:

| Kill Trigger | Threshold | Action |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Zero commercial contracts by Month 6** | 0 new contracts (only Mike's) after 6 months | Pivot to residential-primary model. Stone & Salt becomes a hardscape company with maintenance upsell. |
| **Cumulative revenue under $50K by Month 6** | < $50K by August | Assess whether the business is viable at all. May need to shut down or restructure. |
| **Working capital depleted before break-even** | Savings account hits $0 before cumulative cash turns positive | Stop all non-essential spending. Cut partner draws to $0. Take on subcontract work for immediate cash. |
| **Negative customer feedback pattern** | 3+ complaints or lost contracts due to quality | Field operations problem. Pause growth, fix delivery before selling more. |
| **Partner disagreement on direction** | Fundamental misalignment on strategy, time commitment, or money | Mediate immediately. If unresolvable within 30 days, dissolve the partnership cleanly. |

### 6C. Year 2 Projections (If Year 1 Succeeds)

If Stone & Salt hits the $325K target with 6-8 commercial contracts and 90% retention:

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 (Projected) | Growth |
|--------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Commercial grounds contracts | 8 | 14-16 | +75-100% |
| Commercial snow contracts | 5 | 8-10 | +60-100% |
| Revenue | $325,000 | $550,000-$650,000 | +70-100% |
| Crew size | 2-4 | 5-8 | +100% |
| Gross profit | $100,000 | $180,000-$220,000 | +80-120% |
| Partner income (each) | $37,000 | $65,000-$85,000 | +75-130% |

**Year 2 unlocks:** With 8 reference accounts, commercial sales cycle compresses from 5 months to 2-3 months. Referrals from satisfied clients begin generating organic pipeline. Second crew allows geographic expansion to Anderson Township, Hyde Park, and Montgomery.

## 7. Annual Profit & Loss Summary (Year 1)

| Category | Amount | % of Revenue |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **REVENUE** | | |
| Commercial grounds maintenance | $120,000 | 37% |
| Commercial snow removal | $65,000 | 20% |
| Residential hardscape | $91,000 | 28% |
| Residential maintenance | $49,000 | 15% |
| **Total Revenue** | **$325,000** | **100%** |
| | | |
| **COST OF GOODS SOLD** | | |
| Labor (non-partner) | $28,000 | 9% |
| Materials (salt, pavers, mulch, etc.) | $67,500 | 21% |
| **Total COGS** | **$95,500** | **29%** |
| | | |
| **GROSS PROFIT** | **$229,500** | **71%** |
| | | |
| **OPERATING EXPENSES** | | |
| Partner draws | $75,000 | 23% |
| Insurance (GL + auto + WC) | $9,000 | 3% |
| Equipment payment (tractor) | $5,400 | 2% |
| Fuel & vehicle maintenance | $14,400 | 4% |
| Marketing (Google LSA + misc) | $7,800 | 2% |
| Software/CRM/phone | $4,200 | 1% |
| Accounting/legal | $2,400 | 1% |
| Misc operating | $4,800 | 1% |
| **Total Operating Expenses** | **$123,000** | **38%** |
| | | |
| **NET OPERATING INCOME** | **$106,500** | **33%** |
| | | |
| **LESS: Partner draws (already in OpEx)** | ($75,000) | |
| **RETAINED EARNINGS (Year 1)** | **$31,500** | **10%** |

**Interpretation:** After all expenses including partner draws ($37,500 each), the business retains $31,500 in earnings. This provides a working capital cushion entering Year 2 and funds for equipment upgrades or second-crew investment.

**Tax note:** As an LLC with 50/50 partnership, income passes through to partners' personal returns. Each partner reports ~$53,250 in income ($37,500 draw + $15,750 retained earnings allocation). Estimated quarterly tax payments should begin in Q2.

## 8. Gross Profit Summary by Service Line

| Service Line | Revenue | COGS | Gross Profit | Margin |
|-------------|---------|------|-------------|--------|
| Commercial grounds | $120,000 | $60,000 | $60,000 | 50% |
| Commercial snow | $65,000 | $29,250 | $35,750 | 55% |
| Residential hardscape | $91,000 | $50,050 | $40,950 | 45% |
| Residential maintenance | $49,000 | $34,300 | $14,700 | 30% |
| **TOTAL** | **$325,000** | **$173,600** | **$151,400** | **47%** |

**Note on COGS vs. operating expenses:** COGS above includes direct labor (crew wages) and materials only. The P&L in Section 7 separates COGS ($95,500 -- materials only) from partner draws and overhead. The table above provides a service-line view that includes allocated crew labor in COGS for a truer picture of per-service profitability.

**Margin observations:**
- Commercial grounds at 50% reflects partner-delivered service (no crew labor cost). As crews are hired, margin drops toward the 35% target.
- Commercial snow at 55% assumes $75-85/ton salt. With volatile pricing, drops to 35-45%.
- Hardscape at 45% aligns exactly with the PRICING_BENCHMARKS.md target.
- Residential maintenance at 30% is the floor -- acceptable only as route filler.

## 9. Scenario Modeling: What If Things Go Wrong?

### Scenario A: Slow Commercial Ramp (4 contracts by Year-End instead of 8)

| Metric | Base Case | Slow Ramp | Delta |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Commercial grounds revenue | $120,000 | $60,000 | -$60,000 |
| Commercial snow revenue | $65,000 | $36,000 | -$29,000 |
| Total revenue | $325,000 | $236,000 | -$89,000 |
| Net operating income | $106,500 | $48,000 | -$58,500 |
| Partner income (each) | $37,500 | $24,000 | -$13,500 |

**Verdict:** Survivable. Partners earn $24,000 each -- below poverty line but the business stays alive. Increase hardscape volume to compensate. Reassess commercial strategy.

### Scenario B: No Hardscape Projects (Zero residential hardscape sales)

| Metric | Base Case | No Hardscape | Delta |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Hardscape revenue | $91,000 | $0 | -$91,000 |
| Total revenue | $325,000 | $234,000 | -$91,000 |
| Net operating income | $106,500 | $56,000 | -$50,500 |
| Cash flow crisis month | None | Month 3-5 | Severe |

**Verdict:** Dangerous. Hardscape bridges the cash flow gap months 1-6. Without it, working capital depletes faster and partners may need to inject additional capital. This scenario requires immediate pivoting to subcontract work or commercial hardscape.

### Scenario C: Salt Price Spike to $175/ton + Heavy Winter

| Metric | Base Case | Spike Scenario | Delta |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Snow material costs | $13,000 | $22,000 | +$9,000 |
| Snow gross profit | $35,750 | $26,750 | -$9,000 |
| Net operating income | $106,500 | $97,500 | -$9,000 |

**Verdict:** Manageable with salt surcharge clause. If surcharge is in place, impact is $0. If surcharge is NOT in contracts, $9,000 profit loss -- painful but not fatal.

---

## 10. Financial Model Summary

### The Path to $325K is Achievable If:

1. **Mike's Carwash stays active** (HIGH confidence -- signed contract)
2. **4-6 hardscape projects close in Year 1** (MEDIUM-HIGH confidence -- Cincinnati market supports this)
3. **6-8 commercial contracts close by December** (MEDIUM confidence -- requires disciplined outreach and 15%+ close rate)
4. **Equipment acquired by March 1** (MEDIUM confidence -- used market is available)
5. **Partners maintain lean draws months 1-6** (HIGH confidence -- both committed)

### Capital Required

| Method | Cash Needed Day 1 |
|--------|-------------------|
| Finance tractor | ~$50,000 |
| Pay cash for everything | ~$67,000 |

### Return on Investment

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 (Projected) |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Revenue | $325,000 | $550,000-$650,000 |
| Net operating income | $106,500 | $180,000-$220,000 |
| Partner income (each) | $37,500 | $65,000-$85,000 |
| ROI on $67K investment | 159% | 268-328% |

### The Honest Assessment

The $325K target is realistic but not guaranteed. The model's biggest vulnerability is the 3-6 month commercial sales cycle, which means revenue is heavily backloaded to Q3-Q4. Partners must be prepared for lean months 1-4 where the business loses $5,000-$7,500 in cumulative cash before turning positive.

The Mike's Carwash contract is the single most important asset entering Year 1. It provides $18,000-$28,000 in guaranteed revenue AND serves as a reference account that accelerates every subsequent commercial sale.

Hardscape projects are the critical cash flow bridge. Without them, the business faces a 4-6 month cash desert. Partners should prioritize closing 1-2 hardscape projects before or concurrent with March launch.

If the team executes on outreach volume (50+ PM conversations by March 15), maintains proposal speed advantage (48-72 hours), and leverages Mike's Carwash as a reference -- the $325K path is the most likely outcome.

## NOTES

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Kyle spends 10+ hours/week on sales (Fridays sacred, call blocks non-negotiable)
2. Every visit documented in Jobber (GPS, timestamps, photos) — no exceptions
3. 4-hour response guarantee honored on every inbound
4. Proposals sent within 48-72 hours of site assessment
5. Equipment maintained daily (Chris owns this)

**Common Failure Points to Avoid:**
- Spending too much time mowing, too little on sales (kills pipeline)
- Skipping documentation (breaks website promise, destroys liability defense)
- Waiting too long to follow up on proposals (3-6 month cycle requires patience + persistence)
- Over-buying equipment before revenue supports it (locks up capital)
- Not joining IFMA/IREM (leaves money on the table)

## 1. Entity Structure

### 1A. LLC Formation in Ohio

**Why an LLC (not sole proprietorship or partnership):**
- **Liability protection:** The LLC is a separate legal entity. If Stone & Salt is sued for a slip-and-fall or property damage, creditors generally cannot reach the personal assets of the owners (home, savings, vehicles) unless there is fraud, personal negligence, or the "corporate veil" is pierced.
- **Credibility with commercial clients:** Property managers and procurement teams often require vendor LLCs as a risk management standard. Many commercial contracts explicitly state "Contractor shall be a validly organized LLC or corporation."
- **Tax flexibility:** LLCs can elect pass-through taxation (default) or corporate taxation. For a 50/50 partnership with annual income under $200K, pass-through is typically more favorable.
- **Future restructuring:** The user's broader HoldCo structure will be easier to implement if Stone & Salt is already an LLC (not a sole proprietorship). An LLC can be rolled into a parent entity with minimal paperwork.

**Ohio LLC Formation Process:**

| Step | Action | Cost | Timeline | Notes |
|------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| **1. Name Search** | Search Ohio Secretary of State database for name availability. "Stone & Salt Landscaping LLC" or "Stone & Salt Grounds Management LLC" | Free | 5 minutes | Reserve the name if planning to delay filing. Reservation: $39, holds for 180 days. |
| **2. File Articles of Organization** | File online via Ohio Secretary of State eFile system. Includes: LLC name, principal office address, statutory agent name/address, purpose statement. | $99 (online) or $125 (paper) | Same day (online) to 2-3 weeks (paper) | Online filing is strongly recommended. Use "General landscaping, grounds maintenance, snow and ice management, and related services" as purpose statement. |
| **3. Appoint Statutory Agent** | Required by Ohio law. Can be one of the members or a third-party service. Must have a physical address in Ohio (not P.O. box). | $0 (if member) or $50-$150/year (service) | N/A | One of the partners can serve as agent if comfortable receiving legal notices at their home address. Otherwise use a registered agent service. |
| **4. Obtain EIN** | Apply for Employer Identification Number via IRS Form SS-4 (online, phone, fax, or mail). Required for opening a business bank account, hiring employees, and tax filings. | Free | Immediate (online) to 2-4 weeks (mail) | Online application via IRS website is instant. |
| **5. Draft Operating Agreement** | Internal governance document. See Section 1B below. | $0 (self-draft template) to $800-$1,500 (attorney) | N/A | Ohio does not require filing the OA with the state, but it is essential for dispute resolution and financial/operational clarity. |
| **6. Open Business Bank Account** | Separate business and personal finances. Required for tax compliance and liability protection. Bring: Articles of Organization, EIN letter, Operating Agreement, government-issued ID. | $0-$25/month (depends on bank) | Same day | Huntington Bank, Fifth Third, and PNC all offer business checking in Ohio. Compare monthly fees and transaction limits. |
| **7. Obtain Ohio Business Licenses (if required)** | Butler County and City of Liberty Township do not require general business licenses for landscaping. Confirm with local zoning if operating from a home office. | Varies by municipality | 1-2 weeks | Liberty Township zoning: confirm home-based business is allowed if parking commercial vehicles/trailers at residence. |

**Total Day 1 Cost for LLC Formation: $99 (Articles) + $0 (EIN) + $0-$39 (name reservation if needed) = $99-$138**

**Total Setup Timeline: 1 day (online) to 2 weeks (if any paper filings)**

### 1B. Operating Agreement — Key Provisions

An operating agreement is the internal contract between the two 50/50 partners. It governs capital contributions, profit distribution, decision-making, dispute resolution, and exit scenarios. Ohio does not require filing this document with the state, but it is critical for preventing partnership disputes and clarifying expectations.

**Essential Sections for Stone & Salt Operating Agreement:**

#### Section 1: Formation and Purpose
- LLC name: Stone & Salt Landscaping LLC (or Grounds Management LLC)
- Principal office: [Address in Butler County, OH]
- Purpose: Commercial grounds maintenance, snow and ice management, landscaping, hardscaping, and related property services
- Term: Perpetual (unless dissolved per this Agreement)

#### Section 2: Members and Ownership
- **Member 1:** [Partner 1 Name], 50% ownership
- **Member 2:** [Partner 2 Name], 50% ownership
- Initial capital contributions:
  - Partner 1: $[X] (cash and/or equipment contributed)
  - Partner 2: $[X] (cash and/or equipment contributed)
- Capital accounts: maintained for each member per contributions, distributions, and allocated profits/losses

**IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE HOLDCO RESTRUCTURING:**
Include language that allows for future restructuring: *"The Members may contribute their membership interests to a parent holding company or other entity structure upon unanimous written consent."*

#### Section 3: Management and Decision-Making
- **Management structure:** Member-managed (both partners actively manage the business, as opposed to manager-managed)
- **Voting:** Each member has voting power equal to their ownership percentage (50/50)
- **Ordinary decisions** (day-to-day operations, contracts under $5,000, hiring/firing crew, routine purchases): Either member may act unilaterally
- **Major decisions** (require unanimous consent):
  - Contracts exceeding $10,000 annually
  - Capital expenditures over $5,000 (equipment purchases)
  - Hiring salaried employees or partners
  - Borrowing money or incurring debt over $10,000
  - Selling or encumbering LLC assets
  - Admitting new members
  - Dissolving the LLC
  - Entering into lease agreements exceeding 12 months
  - Changing the principal place of business

**Deadlock resolution:**
- If the members cannot agree on a major decision after good-faith discussion, the decision is tabled for 30 days.
- If still unresolved after 30 days, the members will engage a mutually agreed upon business mediator.
- If mediation fails within 60 days, either member may trigger a buyout provision (Section 7).

#### Section 4: Roles and Responsibilities
To prevent role confusion, define clear ownership:

| Responsibility | Owner |
|---------------|-------|
| Sales, client acquisition, property manager outreach | Partner 1 |
| Proposal preparation and delivery | Partner 1 |
| Client relationship management, quarterly reviews | Partner 1 |
| Invoicing, accounts receivable, QuickBooks | Partner 1 |
| Marketing, website, social media | Partner 1 |
| CRM and pipeline management | Partner 1 |
| Field operations, crew oversight | Partner 2 |
| Equipment acquisition, maintenance, and repair | Partner 2 |
| Quality control and site assessments | Partner 2 |
| Snow event coordination and execution | Partner 2 |
| Hardscape installation project management | Partner 2 |
| Safety compliance and crew training | Partner 2 |
| Joint responsibilities | Hiring crew, strategic planning, financial review (monthly) |

**Time commitment:**
Both members commit to working full-time in the business (minimum 40 hours/week) unless otherwise agreed in writing. If one member reduces time commitment, compensation and profit distribution may be adjusted per Section 5.

#### Section 5: Profit Distribution and Member Draws
- **Draws:** Each member may take monthly draws of up to $[amount] without approval of the other member. Draws above this amount require unanimous consent.
- **Profit distribution:** Net profits (after all expenses, debt service, and agreed-upon reserves) are distributed quarterly (or annually) in proportion to ownership percentage (50/50).
- **Losses:** Allocated 50/50 and used to reduce capital accounts.
- **Tax treatment:** The LLC elects pass-through taxation. Each member is responsible for their share of income taxes on allocated profits (whether or not distributed).

**Recommended initial draw structure:**
- Months 1-3: $2,500/partner/month ($5,000 total)
- Months 4-6: $3,000/partner/month ($6,000 total)
- Months 7+: $3,500/partner/month ($7,000 total)
- Adjust based on actual cash flow and profitability.

#### Section 6: Capital Contributions and Additional Funding
- Initial contributions documented in Section 2 (e.g., Partner 1 contributes $25,000 cash, Partner 2 contributes $25,000 in equipment).
- **Additional capital calls:** If the LLC requires additional capital beyond initial contributions, members contribute in proportion to ownership (50/50). If one member cannot or will not contribute, the contributing member may:
  - Make a loan to the LLC at a commercially reasonable interest rate (to be repaid before profit distributions), or
  - Adjust ownership percentages to reflect additional capital (requires written amendment to this Agreement).

#### Section 7: Buyout and Exit Provisions
**Voluntary exit:**
- If a member wishes to exit, they must provide 90 days written notice.
- The remaining member has a right of first refusal to purchase the exiting member's interest.
- Valuation: Fair market value as determined by an independent business appraiser (CPA or business valuation professional), or as mutually agreed.
- Payment terms: 20% down, balance over 36 months at 5% annual interest.

**Involuntary exit (trigger events):**
- Death or permanent disability of a member
- Bankruptcy or insolvency of a member
- Felony conviction
- Material breach of this Agreement (e.g., fraud, misappropriation of funds, abandonment of duties)
- Deadlock lasting more than 90 days and failure of mediation

Upon a trigger event, the non-exiting member (or their estate) may purchase the exiting member's interest using the same valuation and payment terms as voluntary exit.

**Buy-sell provision (shotgun clause):**
If mediation fails and members cannot agree on dissolution or continuation, either member may invoke a shotgun buyout:
- Offering member names a price for 100% of the business.
- Receiving member has 30 days to either: (a) buy the offering member's 50% share at that price, or (b) sell their 50% share to the offering member at that price.
- This ensures fairness: the offering member must set a price they are willing to accept on either side of the transaction.

#### Section 8: Dispute Resolution
- **Step 1:** Good-faith discussion between members.
- **Step 2:** If unresolved after 14 days, engage a neutral business mediator (cost split 50/50).
- **Step 3:** If mediation fails within 60 days, either member may invoke buyout provisions (Section 7) or proceed to binding arbitration.
- **Arbitration:** Disputes not resolved through mediation shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration to be conducted in Butler County, Ohio. Each member pays their own attorney fees; arbitrator fees split 50/50.
- **Litigation as last resort:** Litigation is permitted only for breaches involving fraud, misappropriation of funds, or threats to the safety/legality of operations. Venue: Butler County Court of Common Pleas.

#### Section 9: Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation
- **During membership:** Members agree not to engage in any competing landscaping or grounds management business in Butler, Warren, Hamilton, or Clermont counties, Ohio, or Boone, Kenton, or Campbell counties, Kentucky.
- **Post-exit:** For 24 months after voluntary exit or involuntary termination, the exiting member agrees not to:
  - Solicit or service any client of Stone & Salt active within 12 months prior to exit.
  - Hire or solicit any employee or subcontractor of Stone & Salt active within 12 months prior to exit.
  - Compete in the same service area (counties listed above) using substantially similar branding or positioning.
- **Geographic limitation:** The non-compete applies only within the defined service area (45-minute radius of Liberty Township, OH).
- **Reasonableness:** This provision is designed to protect client relationships and business value without unreasonably restricting either member's future livelihood. Courts are more likely to enforce a limited, reasonable non-compete than an overly broad one.

#### Section 10: Dissolution and Winding Up
- The LLC may be dissolved upon:
  - Unanimous written consent of members
  - Expiration of the term (if a term was set in Section 1)
  - Occurrence of an event making it unlawful to continue the business
  - Judicial decree
- Upon dissolution:
  - Cease all new business activity
  - Wind up existing contracts and client obligations professionally
  - Liquidate assets and collect receivables
  - Pay all creditors and obligations
  - Distribute remaining assets to members in proportion to positive capital account balances (50/50 if equal)
  - File Articles of Dissolution with Ohio Secretary of State

#### Section 11: Amendments
- This Agreement may be amended only by unanimous written consent of all members.
- Amendments should be documented in writing, signed by all members, and attached to the original Operating Agreement.

**TEMPLATE RECOMMENDATION:**
Use a template from Nolo, LegalZoom, or Rocket Lawyer as a starting point ($50-$150 for a template), then customize for the provisions above. Bring the draft to an Ohio business attorney for review ($400-$800). Do NOT use a generic online template without attorney review -- partnership disputes are the #1 cause of small business failure, and a well-drafted OA is the cheapest insurance you can buy.

### 1C. EIN Application

**Employer Identification Number (EIN)** is the business's "Social Security Number." Required for:
- Opening a business bank account
- Hiring employees (even one)
- Filing business tax returns
- Obtaining business insurance
- Executing contracts with clients (many commercial clients require it)

**How to Apply (Free):**
1. Online: [IRS EIN Online Application](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online)
   - Instant approval
   - Must complete in one session
   - Available Monday-Friday, 7am-10pm ET
2. By Fax: Submit Form SS-4 (download from IRS website)
   - 4-5 business days

   - 4-6 weeks

**Recommendation:** Apply online the same day the LLC is formed. It takes 10 minutes and you receive the EIN immediately.

---

### 1D. Business Bank Account Setup

**Why a separate business account is legally required:**
- IRS requires separate business/personal finances for tax compliance
- Commingling funds can "pierce the corporate veil" and destroy liability protection
- Simplifies accounting, tax filing, and financial audits
- Enables professional invoicing and payment processing

**What to bring to the bank:**
- Articles of Organization (filed with Ohio SOS)
- Operating Agreement
- EIN confirmation letter (or EIN number)
- Government-issued photo ID (both members)
- Initial deposit (varies by bank, typically $25-$100)

**Local bank options in Greater Cincinnati:**
- **Huntington Bank:** Free business checking for first year, then $15/month. No transaction limits. Good for seasonal businesses (no fees for zero balance months).
- **Fifth Third Bank:** $12/month, 200 transactions included. Good mobile banking.
- **PNC Bank:** $15/month, waived with $500 minimum balance. Strong business services.
- **First Financial Bank:** Local Cincinnati bank, relationship-focused. $10/month.

**Recommendation:** Huntington or Fifth Third. Both have good online banking, local branches, and support QuickBooks integration.

## 2. Insurance Requirements

Stone & Salt operates in a high-liability industry. Snow and ice management is the single highest-liability service in landscaping -- a slip-and-fall claim can result in a $50,000-$500,000 lawsuit. Insurance is not optional.

### 2A. General Liability Insurance ($2M Coverage)

**What it covers:**
- Bodily injury to third parties (client, tenant, visitor slips and falls)
- Property damage (equipment damages a client's irrigation system, vehicle hits a building)
- Personal injury and advertising injury (libel, slander, copyright infringement)
- Legal defense costs (even if the claim is baseless, the insurer pays to defend)

**Why $2M and not $1M:**
- **Commercial client requirement:** The research indicates property managers typically require $2M minimum. Many contracts explicitly state "$2M general liability with client named as additional insured."
- **Snow liability:** Slip-and-fall claims in commercial settings regularly exceed $1M in settlements/judgments. A $1M policy may not fully protect the business or the owners.
- **Cost difference is minimal:** The difference between $1M and $2M coverage is typically $300-$800/year. This is cheap protection.

**Coverage structure:**
- $2,000,000 General Aggregate
- $2,000,000 Products/Completed Operations Aggregate
- $1,000,000 Each Occurrence
- $100,000 Fire Damage (any one fire)
- $5,000 Medical Expense (any one person)

**Snow and ice endorsement (REQUIRED):**
Standard GL policies often exclude or limit snow/ice coverage. You MUST add a snow and ice management endorsement. This increases the premium by 30-50% but is non-negotiable. Without it, snow claims are not covered.

**Additional insured endorsement:**
Commercial clients will require Stone & Salt to name them as "additional insured" on the policy. This extends coverage to the client for claims arising from Stone & Salt's work. Most insurers provide this at no additional cost if requested during policy issuance.

**Estimated Cost:**
- Base GL policy ($1M): $800-$1,500/year
- Increased to $2M: +$300-$500/year
- Snow/ice endorsement: +$800-$1,500/year
- **Total: $1,900-$3,500/year for $2M GL with snow endorsement**

This is slightly below the financial model's $4,500/year budget for GL, which provides a buffer.

---

### 2B. Commercial Auto Insurance

**What it covers:**
- Vehicle damage (collision and comprehensive)
- Liability for injuries/property damage caused by business vehicles
- Medical payments
- Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage

**What requires coverage:**
- Pickup trucks used for business (towing trailers, transporting equipment, driving to job sites)
- Any vehicle with a plow attachment
- Trailers (if not covered under inland marine)

**Coverage limits:**
- Bodily injury: $100,000 per person / $300,000 per accident (minimum)
- Property damage: $100,000 per accident (minimum)
- Recommended: $250,000/$500,000/$100,000 for commercial use
- Collision and comprehensive with deductible ($500-$1,000)

**Plow attachment coverage:**
Some insurers exclude or limit coverage for vehicles with plow attachments during snow operations. Verify that plowing is explicitly covered, not excluded.

**Estimated Cost:**
- Per vehicle: $1,200-$1,800/year (commercial use with plow endorsement)
- Two vehicles: $2,400-$3,600/year

This matches the financial model's $3,600/year estimate.

---

### 2C. Equipment / Inland Marine Insurance

**What it covers:**
- Theft of equipment (zero-turn mower stolen from job site or trailer)
- Damage to equipment (mower hits a curb and cracks the deck, spreader falls off trailer)
- Tools and hand equipment (trimmers, blowers, hand tools)
- Trailers

**Why it is called "Inland Marine":**
Historical insurance term for coverage of movable property. Despite the name, it has nothing to do with boats or water.

**What to insure:**
- Commercial zero-turn mower: $17,000
- Sub-compact tractor (if purchased): $22,000-$27,000
- Trailer: $4,000
- Hand equipment package: $3,500
- Salt spreader, Bobcat pusher, etc.: $4,000
- **Total insured value: $50,000-$55,000**

**Coverage:**
- Replacement cost (not depreciated actual cash value)
- Deductible: $500-$1,000
- Covers theft, vandalism, fire, collision, overturn, weather damage

**Estimated Cost:**
- $50,000 of equipment: $400-$800/year (0.8-1.6% of value)
- Add higher-value items as they are acquired (e.g., tractor added mid-year)

This is below the financial model's allocated budget, leaving room for higher premiums if needed.

---

### 2D. Workers' Compensation Insurance (Ohio BWC)

**What it covers:**
- Medical expenses for employee injuries on the job
- Lost wages during recovery
- Permanent disability benefits
- Death benefits to employee's family

**Ohio-specific requirement:**
- Ohio is a **monopolistic state** for workers' comp -- you cannot buy private workers' comp insurance. All employers must obtain coverage through the **Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC)**.
- Required as soon as you hire your first employee (even part-time or seasonal).

**How to enroll:**
1. Online: [Ohio BWC Employer Registration](https://www.bwc.ohio.gov/)
2. Classify your business by industry code (NAIC code for landscaping: 0042 - Landscape Contractors)
3. Pay initial premium based on estimated annual payroll
4. Premiums are adjusted annually based on actual payroll and claims history

**Premium calculation:**
- Based on payroll and classification risk rating
- Landscaping/grounds maintenance: Moderate risk
- Snow removal: Higher risk (increased injury rate)
- First-year estimate: 8-12% of gross payroll
- Example: $40,000 annual crew payroll = $3,200-$4,800/year premium

**When to enroll:**
- BEFORE hiring the first crew member (Month 5 per the financial model).
- Operating without BWC coverage when you have employees is a criminal violation in Ohio. Fines start at $1,000/day.

**Estimated Cost:**
- Year 1 (one crew member, $40,000 payroll): $3,200-$4,800/year
- Paid quarterly

This exceeds the financial model's $3,000 allocation slightly. Adjust to $3,500-$4,000 for workers' comp.

---

### 2E. Umbrella / Excess Liability Insurance

**What it covers:**
Excess coverage above the limits of GL and auto policies. If a claim exceeds the $2M GL limit, the umbrella policy covers the excess up to its limit (typically $5M or $10M).

**When it is needed:**
- Not required in Year 1 if GL is $2M
- Consider adding in Year 2 when revenue exceeds $500K or when servicing high-value properties (corporate campuses, large medical facilities, regional retail centers)

**Estimated Cost:**
- $5M umbrella: $500-$1,000/year
- $10M umbrella: $800-$1,500/year

**Recommendation:** Skip umbrella in Year 1. Revisit in Year 2 or if a major contract requires it.

---

### 2F. Property Manager Insurance Requirements

**What commercial property managers typically REQUIRE from vendors:**

Based on the research, here are standard vendor insurance minimums:

| Coverage | Typical Minimum | Stone & Salt Position |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| General Liability | $1M-$2M per occurrence | $2M (meets/exceeds) |
| Auto Liability | $1M combined single limit | $250K/$500K/$100K (adequate for most; some may require $1M) |
| Workers' Compensation | Statutory (Ohio BWC) | Ohio BWC enrollment (compliant) |
| Additional Insured | Client named on GL policy | Provided upon request |
| Certificate of Insurance | Provided before work begins | Provided with every proposal |
| Waiver of Subrogation | Insurer waives right to sue client | May require endorsement (add $50-$150 to premium) |

**Certificate of Insurance (COI):**
- Property managers will request a COI before approving vendor registration or signing a contract.
- The COI is a one-page document from your insurer showing coverage types, limits, effective dates, and named insured.
- Most insurers provide unlimited COIs at no cost.
- Turnaround: 24-48 hours via email.

**Additional Insured endorsement:**
- Property managers require this to protect themselves from liability arising from your work.
- Example: Tenant slips on ice. Tenant sues both Stone & Salt and the property owner. The property owner's defense costs are covered by Stone & Salt's GL policy because they are named as additional insured.
- Most GL policies include this at no cost if requested.

**Waiver of Subrogation:**
- Prevents Stone & Salt's insurer from suing the property owner if the insurer pays a claim.
- Example: Stone & Salt's truck is damaged by a pothole on client's property. Insurer pays the claim. Without a waiver of subrogation, the insurer could sue the property owner to recover costs. With the waiver, the insurer cannot sue.
- Some clients require this; others do not. If required, it typically adds $50-$150 to annual premium.

---

### 2F. Estimated Total Insurance Costs

| Coverage | Annual Premium | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| General Liability ($2M with snow endorsement) | $1,900-$3,500 | Higher end if snow volume is large |
| Commercial Auto (2 vehicles) | $2,400-$3,600 | Includes plow endorsement |
| Inland Marine (Equipment) | $400-$800 | $50K of equipment |
| Workers' Comp (Ohio BWC) | $3,200-$4,800 | Based on $40K crew payroll |
| **TOTAL Year 1** | **$7,900-$12,700** | |

**Financial model budget: $12,000/year ($3,000/quarter)**

The model's budget is adequate, especially if Year 1 crew hiring is delayed or part-time. If full-time crew is hired in Month 5 as planned, budget $10,000-$12,000 for total insurance.

**Where to get quotes:**
- **Specialty landscaping/snow removal insurers:**
  - Philadelphia Insurance Companies (PHLY)
  - Society Insurance
  - The Hartford (small business division)
  - Progressive Commercial
- **Local independent insurance brokers in Cincinnati:** Search "commercial insurance broker Butler County Ohio" and request quotes from 2-3 brokers. Brokers shop multiple carriers and can package all coverage into one policy, often at lower cost than buying separately.

**Timeline:**
- Get quotes 2-3 weeks before first client service
- Allow 7-10 days for underwriting and policy issuance
- Obtain COI before first proposal delivery

## 3. Contract Templates — Key Provisions

These are frameworks for what each contract type should include. They are NOT ready-to-use contracts. An attorney must draft or review all final contract language.

---

### 3A. Commercial Grounds Maintenance Contract

- Client: [Property Management Company or Property Owner Name]
- Property Address: [Specific property covered]
- Effective Date and Term: [Start date] through [End date] (typically 12 months)

#### 2. Scope of Work
**Be hyper-specific. Ambiguity creates disputes.**

The research emphasizes that visit frequency (28 vs. 32 visits) is a core differentiator and the #1 source of bid comparison disputes.

**Example scope language:**

"Contractor shall provide grounds maintenance services at the Property for the term of this Agreement, consisting of the following:"

**A. Mowing Services (28 visits per season, approximately April 1 through October 31)**
- Mow all turf areas to a height of 3-3.5 inches

- Inspect plants for disease or pest damage (report findings, treatment billed separately)

**F. Seasonal Cleanups (2 per year)**

- Fall cleanup (one visit, November): Remove fallen leaves from turf and beds, final mowing, cut back perennials, prepare beds for winter

**G. Mulch Application (1 application per year, May)**
- Apply 2-3 inches of hardwood mulch to all landscape beds

- Estimated quantity: [X] cubic yards

**EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS:**
The following services are NOT included in this Agreement and will be billed separately if requested:

- Pest control or pesticide/herbicide application
- Hardscape installation or repair
- Snow and ice management (see separate Snow & Ice Agreement)
- Services beyond the specified visit count
- Repairs to damage caused by third parties, weather, or vandalism

#### 3. Service Standards and Documentation
"Contractor shall perform all services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards. Services shall be documented with GPS-tracked visit logs, timestamps, crew identification, and photographic records. Client may request documentation for any visit at any time."

#### 4. Pricing and Payment Terms

**Pricing structure (choose one):**

**Option A: Monthly Retainer (12 equal payments)**
"Total annual contract value: $[X]. Client shall pay Contractor $[X/12] per month, due on the 1st of each month, regardless of visit frequency in that month. Payment terms: Net-30 from invoice date."

**Option B: Seasonal Billing (9 payments, April-December)**
"Total annual contract value: $[X]. Client shall pay Contractor $[X/9] per month during the service season (April 1 through December 31). Payment terms: Net-30 from invoice date."

**Late payment provision:**
"Invoices not paid within 30 days of invoice date shall accrue interest at 1.5% per month (18% annually). Contractor may suspend services if payment is more than 60 days overdue, with 14 days written notice to Client."

**Multi-year pricing (optional):**
"Client may elect a two-year agreement at the time of signing. Year 2 pricing shall not increase by more than 3% above Year 1 pricing."

#### 5. Material Cost Provisions
The research emphasizes the importance of material cost escalation clauses to protect against input cost volatility (especially relevant for mulch, fertilizer, and other materials).

"Pricing assumes current material costs as of [contract date]. If material costs (mulch, fertilizer, soil amendments, plants) increase by more than 15% year-over-year, Contractor may adjust pricing with 30 days written notice to Client. Client may terminate this Agreement within 14 days of receiving such notice without penalty."

#### 6. Term and Renewal
"This Agreement shall commence on [start date] and continue for 12 months, ending on [end date]. This Agreement shall automatically renew for successive 12-month terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least 60 days prior to the end of the then-current term."

**Why auto-renewal is critical:**
Commercial contracts often renew automatically unless actively cancelled. This prevents clients from "forgetting" to renew and creates continuity of revenue. Many property managers prefer auto-renewal because it reduces administrative burden.

#### 7. Termination Provisions

**Termination for Cause:**
"Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause with 14 days written notice if the other party: (a) materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure within 14 days of written notice; (b) files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent; or (c) engages in fraud, willful misconduct, or illegal activity."

**Termination for Convenience:**
"Client may terminate this Agreement for convenience with 60 days written notice. If Client terminates for convenience, Client shall pay Contractor for all services performed through the termination date, plus 30% of the remaining contract value (to cover Contractor's committed costs and lost profit)."

**Termination by Contractor:**
"Contractor may terminate this Agreement with 30 days written notice if Client fails to pay invoices within 60 days of invoice date."

#### 8. Insurance and Indemnification

**Insurance representation:**
"Contractor represents and warrants that it maintains general liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence, commercial auto insurance, and workers' compensation insurance as required by Ohio law. Contractor shall name Client as an additional insured on its general liability policy upon request and shall provide a certificate of insurance before commencing work."

**Mutual indemnification (standard for commercial contracts):**
"Each party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party from and against any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising out of the indemnifying party's negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of this Agreement."

**IMPORTANT:** This is mutual (both parties indemnify each other), not one-way (only Contractor indemnifies Client). Many clients will request one-way indemnification. Negotiate this carefully -- one-way indemnification can expose Stone & Salt to unreasonable liability.

#### 9. Limitation of Liability
"Contractor's total liability under this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the total amount paid by Client to Contractor under this Agreement in the 12 months preceding the claim."

**Why this matters:**
Without a limitation of liability, Stone & Salt could theoretically be liable for unlimited damages. For example, if a crew member accidentally damages a sprinkler head and flooding causes $50,000 in building damage, the contract limits Stone & Salt's liability to the annual contract value (e.g., $18,000), not the full $50,000. Insurance covers the rest.

**Note:** Many commercial clients will push back on this provision. It is negotiable but worth requesting.

#### 10. Force Majeure
"Neither party shall be liable for failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement if such failure is caused by events beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, labor disputes, government orders, pandemic, severe weather, or utility failures. If a force majeure event prevents performance for more than 30 consecutive days, either party may terminate this Agreement without penalty."

**Why this matters for Stone & Salt:**
If extreme weather (drought, flood, prolonged rain) prevents mowing for weeks, this clause protects Stone & Salt from breach claims. Similarly, if a pandemic or government order shuts down operations (as happened in 2020), neither party is in breach.

#### 11. Dispute Resolution
"In the event of any dispute arising under this Agreement, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute through good-faith negotiation. If negotiation fails within 30 days, the parties agree to mediation before a neutral mediator mutually agreed upon. If mediation fails within 60 days, the parties may proceed to litigation. Venue for any litigation shall be the Court of Common Pleas, Butler County, Ohio."

**Optional binding arbitration clause (alternative to litigation):**
"Any dispute not resolved through mediation shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall be conducted in Butler County, Ohio. Each party shall pay its own attorney fees; arbitrator fees shall be split equally."

#### 12. General Provisions
- **Entire Agreement:** "This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral."
- **Amendments:** "This Agreement may be amended only by written agreement signed by both parties."
- **Assignment:** "Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party."
- **Notices:** "All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and delivered to the addresses listed in Section 1, or to such other addresses as a party may designate in writing."
- **Governing Law:** "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio."
- **Severability:** "If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect."

### 3B. Snow & Ice Management Contract

**Purpose:** Seasonal agreement (typically November 1 - March 31) for snow plowing, de-icing, and sidewalk clearing.

**Critical difference from grounds maintenance:**
Snow contracts carry **significantly higher liability risk** (slip-and-fall claims). The contract must be airtight on triggers, service windows, documentation, and liability allocation.

**Key Sections:**

#### 1. Parties, Property, and Season
- Same as grounds contract
- Season: November 1, [Year] through March 31, [Year+1]

#### 2. Scope of Work

**Two contract architectures (offer both; client chooses):**

---

**OPTION A: Fixed Seasonal Contract (Maximum Predictability)**

"Contractor shall provide unlimited snow and ice management services at the Property for the Season, consisting of:"

**A. Plowing Services**
- Trigger threshold: Plowing begins when snow accumulation reaches 2 inches
- Service window: Lots cleared before 6:00 AM on business days (Monday-Friday). Weekend/holiday events cleared within 4 hours of trigger.
- Plowing standard: All parking areas, drive lanes, and loading zones plowed to bare pavement or best achievable condition given ongoing precipitation
- Snow stacking: Snow pushed to designated stacking areas identified on attached site map (Exhibit A)

**B. Sidewalk and Walkway Clearing**
- All pedestrian sidewalks, building entrances, and ADA-accessible paths cleared within 4 hours of event conclusion
- Clearing standard: Bare pavement or best achievable condition
- Priority areas: Main entrances, ADA paths, emergency exits (cleared first)

**C. De-Icing / Salt Application**
- Post-storm: Salt or ice melt applied to all cleared surfaces after plowing complete
- Pre-treatment: Brine or treated salt applied before forecasted freezing precipitation when conditions warrant (Contractor's discretion)
- Re-icing prevention: Salt re-applied if conditions create new ice formation post-event

**D. Re-Trigger Service**
- If additional accumulation exceeds trigger threshold after initial clearing, Contractor returns for a second pass at no additional charge

**E. 24/7 Monitoring and Response**
- Contractor monitors weather forecasts and precipitation continuously from November 1 through March 31
- Guaranteed response: Crew dispatched within 30 minutes of trigger confirmation

**Pricing:**
"Total seasonal fee: $[X], payable in equal monthly installments of $[X/5] on the 1st of each month (November, December, January, February, March). This fee covers unlimited plowing events, salt applications, and services described above, regardless of snowfall totals."

**Salt surcharge clause (CRITICAL):**
"Pricing is based on pre-season bulk salt rate of $100/ton. If actual bulk salt costs exceed $115/ton, Contractor may pass through the incremental cost at actual cost plus 10% handling fee, with 14 days written notice to Client and supporting documentation (supplier invoice). Client may terminate this Agreement within 7 days of such notice without penalty."

**Why $100/ton baseline and $115/ton threshold:**
The research shows Butler County procurement at $96.40/ton (May 2025), with historical volatility to $140+/ton. A $100 baseline is reasonable. The $115 threshold provides a 15% buffer before surcharges kick in, preventing minor fluctuations from triggering mid-season price changes.

---

**OPTION B: Readiness Fee + Per-Event Variable (Shared Risk)**

"Contractor shall provide snow and ice management services at the Property for the Season on a readiness-plus-variable basis, consisting of:"

**Monthly Readiness Fee: $[X] per month (November-March, 5 payments)**
Covers:
- Equipment staging and pre-positioning
- Weather monitoring 24/7
- Route planning and crew standby
- Priority response guarantee (within 30 minutes of trigger)
- Pre-treatment brine applications (unlimited)

**Per-Event Fee (billed within 48 hours of event completion):**
- **2-4 inches accumulation:** $[X] per event
- **4-8 inches accumulation:** $[1.5X] per event
- **8+ inches accumulation:** $[2X] per event
- **Sidewalk clearing:** $[Y] per event (if not included in plowing fee)
- **Salt application:** $[Z] per application, metered

"Client pays readiness fee regardless of snowfall. Client pays per-event fees only for actual service events. Total seasonal cost depends on weather: mild winter = lower cost; heavy winter = higher cost."

**When to recommend Option A vs. Option B:**
- **Option A (Fixed Seasonal):** Clients who prioritize budget certainty and cannot absorb variable costs. HOAs, medical facilities, and corporate campuses often prefer this.
- **Option B (Readiness + Variable):** Clients who are financially sophisticated and willing to share weather risk for potentially lower costs. Retail centers and office parks with lean budgets often prefer this.

---

#### 3. Trigger Definitions and Service Windows

**This section prevents disputes. Be hyper-specific.**

**Trigger threshold:**
"Plowing is triggered when snow accumulation reaches 2 inches as measured by Contractor at the Property. Contractor uses [Weather Underground / National Weather Service / on-site measurement] as the measurement standard."

**Why 2 inches is standard:**
Most commercial contracts use 2-inch triggers. Some clients request 1-inch (more service, higher cost) or 3-inch (less service, higher slip-and-fall risk). The research shows 2 inches is the industry norm in Cincinnati.

**Service window commitment:**
"Contractor commits to the following service windows:
- **Business days (Monday-Friday):** Lots cleared before 6:00 AM
- **Weekends/holidays:** Lots cleared within 4 hours of trigger
- **Sidewalks:** Cleared within 4 hours of event conclusion
- **Re-icing response:** Within 2 hours of Client notification"

**Definition of "event conclusion":**
"An event is considered concluded when precipitation has stopped and no additional accumulation is forecasted within the next 6 hours."

#### 4. Site Map and Documentation

**Exhibit A: Site Map**
Attach an annotated property map showing:
- Plowing routes and priorities
- Snow stacking locations
- Sidewalk clearing areas
- ADA paths and emergency exits
- Obstacles, hazards, medians, curb islands
- Salt-sensitive areas (near landscaping, water features)

**Service documentation:**
"Contractor shall document every service event with GPS-tracked arrival/departure timestamps, photographic evidence of cleared surfaces, material quantities applied (salt/ice melt), and weather conditions. Documentation shall be provided to Client within 24 hours of event completion via email or client portal."

**Why documentation is mission-critical:**
The research repeatedly emphasizes that documented service is THE liability defense for slip-and-fall claims. Property managers need timestamped proof that service was performed. This documentation is not a "nice to have" -- it is the reason sophisticated clients choose Stone & Salt over cheaper competitors.

#### 5. Pricing and Payment (per Option A or B above)

#### 6. Insurance and Liability

**Enhanced insurance representation:**
"Contractor represents and warrants that it maintains:
- General liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence, including snow and ice management endorsement
- Commercial auto insurance with plow attachment coverage
- Workers' compensation insurance as required by Ohio law
Contractor shall name Client as an additional insured and provide a certificate of insurance before the Season begins."

**Liability allocation (CRITICAL -- attorney must review):**

**Contractor's responsibility:**
"Contractor is responsible for performing services as described in this Agreement in a professional and workmanlike manner. Contractor is liable for damages arising from Contractor's negligence or failure to perform services as specified in this Agreement."

**Client's responsibility:**
"Client is responsible for ensuring that the Property is accessible (gates unlocked, access codes provided) and for promptly notifying Contractor of any conditions requiring re-service or additional attention."

**Limits of Contractor liability:**
"Contractor is NOT liable for:
- Slip-and-fall injuries or property damage occurring BEFORE Contractor's service is performed
- Injuries or damage occurring AFTER service is performed if conditions change due to new precipitation, refreezing, or other events beyond Contractor's control
- Damage caused by pre-existing property conditions (potholes, drainage issues, uneven pavement, hidden obstacles)
- Injuries occurring in areas not covered by this Agreement (e.g., roofs, private sidewalks, areas not identified on site map)
- Delays in service caused by force majeure events (extreme weather preventing crew access, impassable roads, utility failures)"

**ADA compliance:**
"Contractor shall clear ADA-accessible paths as identified on the site map. Client is responsible for ensuring that the site map accurately identifies all required ADA paths. Contractor's obligation is limited to the paths identified on the site map."

#### 7. Force Majeure (Expanded for Snow)
"Contractor shall not be liable for failure to perform services if such failure is caused by extreme weather conditions preventing crew access (impassable roads, whiteout conditions, ice storms exceeding equipment capacity), government-ordered travel bans, utility failures, or other events beyond Contractor's reasonable control. If Contractor cannot perform services due to force majeure, Contractor shall notify Client as soon as reasonably possible and shall resume services as soon as conditions permit."

#### 8. Term and Cancellation

**Non-refundable after November 15:**
"This Agreement may be cancelled by Client with 30 days written notice before November 15. After November 15, seasonal fees are non-refundable, as Contractor has committed crews, equipment, and materials for the Season."

**Why November 15 is the cutoff:**
By mid-November, contractors have purchased salt, staged equipment, and committed labor. If a client cancels in December, the contractor has already incurred most of their fixed costs and cannot reallocate resources.

#### 9. Dispute Resolution, Indemnification, and General Provisions
Same structure as grounds contract (Section 3A above).

---

### 3C. Estate Mowing Agreement

**Purpose:** Simplified maintenance agreement for large residential properties (1.5+ acres of mowable turf).

**Key Differences from Commercial Grounds Contract:**
- Simpler scope (primarily mowing, trimming, blowing)
- Lighter legal terms (no indemnification required for residential)
- Seasonal billing (April-October)
- Fewer documentation requirements

**Structure (4-5 pages):**

1. **Parties and Property**
2. **Scope of Work**
   - Mowing: 28 or 32 visits, April-October
   - Acreage: [X] acres of mowable turf
   - Terrain: [flat / rolling / steep slopes]
   - Mowing height: 3-3.5 inches
   - Trimming, edging, blowing included each visit
   - Spring cleanup (1 visit)
   - Fall cleanup (1 visit)
3. **Pricing and Payment**
   - Per-visit rate: $[X] per visit
   - Seasonal total: $[X] for 28 visits
   - Monthly billing option: $[X/month] April-October (7 payments)
   - Add-on menu: mulch, bed work, seasonal plantings (priced separately)
4. **Service Standards**
   - Professional, workmanlike manner
   - Basic photo documentation (not GPS-tracked unless requested)
5. **Term and Renewal**
   - Season: April 1 - October 31
   - Auto-renews annually unless 30 days notice
6. **Termination**
   - Either party may terminate with 30 days notice
   - No early termination penalty (residential agreements are more flexible than commercial)
7. **General Provisions**
   - Governing law: Ohio
   - Entire agreement
   - Amendment in writing

**No indemnification clause needed for residential.**
**No limitation of liability needed (insurance covers this).**
**No dispute resolution clause needed (small claims court is sufficient for residential disputes).**

---

## 4. Subcontractor Agreement Template

**Purpose:** When Stone & Salt needs overflow capacity (large snow event, overlapping hardscape project, crew absence), subcontractors provide labor/equipment under Stone & Salt's brand and direction.

**Critical principle:** The client contracts with Stone & Salt, not the subcontractor. The subcontractor is invisible to the client. Stone & Salt remains fully liable for quality and performance.

**Key Sections:**

#### 1. Parties
- Contractor: Stone & Salt Landscaping LLC
- Subcontractor: [Subcontractor Name or Company]

#### 2. Scope of Work
"Subcontractor shall provide the following services at the direction of Contractor: [landscaping labor, snow plowing, equipment operation, etc.]"

"Subcontractor acknowledges that it is working under Contractor's direction and brand. Subcontractor shall not represent itself as an independent contractor to Client, shall not solicit Client directly, and shall not display its own branding or signage while performing services under this Agreement."

#### 3. Compensation
"Contractor shall pay Subcontractor $[X] per hour / per property / per event, payable within 30 days of invoice submission by Subcontractor. Subcontractor shall submit invoices with documentation of hours/services performed."

**Typical sub rates:**
- 60-70% of Contractor's billing rate
- Example: Contractor bills $18,000/year for grounds contract, pays sub $10,800-$12,600/year (retains $5,400-$7,200 as management margin)

#### 4. Insurance Requirements
"Subcontractor represents and warrants that it maintains:
- General liability insurance of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence
- Commercial auto insurance (if using own vehicles)
- Workers' compensation insurance (if employing anyone other than itself)

Subcontractor shall provide Contractor with a certificate of insurance before commencing work."

**Why this is critical:**
If a subcontractor is uninsured and causes damage or injury, Stone & Salt's insurance will pay the claim, but Stone & Salt's premiums will increase and the incident will damage Stone & Salt's reputation. Requiring subs to carry their own insurance transfers this risk.

#### 5. Quality Standards
"Subcontractor shall perform all services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards and Contractor's quality specifications. Contractor may inspect Subcontractor's work at any time and may require re-work at Subcontractor's expense if work does not meet Contractor's standards."

#### 6. Indemnification
"Subcontractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Contractor from and against any claims, damages, losses, or expenses arising out of Subcontractor's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement, including but not limited to bodily injury, property damage, or violations of law."

**Why this is one-way (not mutual):**
Stone & Salt is the "general contractor" and the sub is the "sub-contractor." The sub indemnifies Stone & Salt for the sub's work. This is standard construction/landscaping subcontractor practice.

#### 7. Independent Contractor Status
"Subcontractor is an independent contractor, not an employee of Contractor. Subcontractor is responsible for all taxes, insurance, and benefits for itself and its employees. Subcontractor shall not be entitled to any employee benefits from Contractor."

"Subcontractor acknowledges that it controls the manner and means of performing services, subject to Contractor's quality standards and specifications."

**Why this is legally critical:**
If the IRS or Ohio Department of Taxation determines that the subcontractor is actually an employee (not an independent contractor), Stone & Salt could be liable for back taxes, penalties, and workers' comp premiums. The factors the IRS considers:
- **Behavioral control:** Does Stone & Salt control HOW the work is done? (Yes = employee)
- **Financial control:** Does the sub have their own equipment, work for other clients, invoice for services? (Yes = independent contractor)
- **Relationship:** Is this ongoing/indefinite or project-based? (Ongoing = employee, project-based = contractor)

To maintain independent contractor status:
- Use subs for specific projects or overflow, not as regular crew
- Subs use their own equipment
- Subs invoice Stone & Salt, not paid hourly via payroll
- Subs work for other companies, not exclusively for Stone & Salt

#### 8. Non-Solicitation
"Subcontractor agrees not to solicit, contact, or service any client of Contractor introduced to Subcontractor through this Agreement, for a period of 24 months after the termination of this Agreement, without Contractor's prior written consent."

**Why this matters:**
If a subcontractor clears snow at a property, meets the property manager, and then offers to undercut Stone & Salt's pricing, Stone & Salt loses the client relationship. This provision prevents that.

#### 9. Term and Termination
"This Agreement may be terminated by either party with 7 days written notice. Contractor may terminate immediately if Subcontractor fails to maintain required insurance, performs substandard work, or breaches this Agreement."

#### 10. General Provisions
Same structure as contracts above (governing law: Ohio, entire agreement, etc.)

---

## 5. Employment Law Compliance (Ohio)

### 5A. Ohio Minimum Wage (2026)

**Current minimum wage: $11.00/hour (non-tipped), effective January 1, 2026**

Source: Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Labor and Worker Safety.

**Stone & Salt crew wage plan: $20/hour**
- Well above minimum wage
- Competitive with warehouse and construction alternatives
- Justifies the rate based on: year-round employment (not seasonal), equipment operation skills, professional service standards

**Tipped employees:**
Stone & Salt has no tipped employees (not applicable).

---

### 5B. Workers' Compensation Enrollment (Ohio BWC)

**Requirement:**
Ohio law requires ALL employers to carry workers' compensation insurance through the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) as soon as they hire their first employee (even part-time or seasonal).

**Timeline:**
Enroll BEFORE hiring the first crew member (Month 5 per the financial model).

**How to enroll:**
1. Online: [BWC Employer Portal](https://www.bwc.ohio.gov/)
2. Complete Employer Registration Form
3. Classify business by NAIC code: 0042 (Landscape Contractors)
4. Estimate annual payroll
5. Pay initial premium (based on estimated payroll and risk classification)

**Premium calculation:**
- Based on payroll, classification risk, and claims history
- Landscaping: Moderate risk (manual labor, equipment operation)
- Snow removal: Higher risk (increased injury rate, night/emergency operations)
- Estimated: 8-12% of gross payroll
- Example: $40,000 payroll = $3,200-$4,800 annual premium
- Billed quarterly

**Claims history:**
- First year: state average rate (no claims history)
- Year 2+: experience-rated. Clean safety record = lower premiums. Claims = higher premiums.

**Penalties for non-compliance:**
- Operating without BWC coverage when you have employees is a criminal violation
- Fines: $1,000/day of non-compliance
- Personal liability for owners if employee is injured while uninsured

---

### 5C. Payroll Tax Obligations

**Federal:**
- **FICA (Social Security + Medicare):** 7.65% employer share (withheld from employee wages, matched by employer)
- **FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax):** 6.0% on first $7,000 of wages per employee (reduced to 0.6% if state unemployment taxes are paid)
- **Income tax withholding:** Withhold federal income tax per employee's Form W-4

**Ohio State:**
- **State unemployment tax (SUTA):** 2.7% for new employers (first 2-3 years), then experience-rated. Paid on first $9,000 of wages per employee.
- **Ohio income tax withholding:** Withhold state income tax per employee's Ohio IT-4 form

**Reporting:**
- Quarterly: Federal Form 941 (FICA + income tax withholding)
- Annually: Federal Form 940 (FUTA), W-2s for employees, W-3 transmittal
- Ohio: Quarterly Ohio IT-501 (state withholding)

**Recommendation:**
Use a payroll service (Gusto, QuickBooks Payroll, ADP) to handle withholding, remittance, and reporting. Cost: $40-$60/month base + $6-$10/employee. This is cheaper than the cost of making a mistake on payroll taxes (penalties start at 10% of unpaid tax).

---

### 5D. Employee vs. Contractor Classification

**Critical distinction:**
Employees are on payroll, receive W-2s, have taxes withheld, and are entitled to minimum wage, overtime, and workers' comp.

Independent contractors receive 1099-NEC, pay their own taxes, and are not entitled to employee protections.

**IRS 3-factor test:**

| Factor | Employee | Independent Contractor |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| **Behavioral control** | Employer controls when, where, and how work is done | Contractor controls their own methods and schedule |
| **Financial control** | Paid hourly/salary, uses employer's equipment, works exclusively for employer | Invoices for services, uses own equipment, works for multiple clients |
| **Relationship** | Ongoing, indefinite, integral to business | Project-based, temporary, not integral to core business |

**How this applies to Stone & Salt:**

**Crew members (hired in Month 5+): EMPLOYEES**
- Work set hours under direct supervision
- Use Stone & Salt's equipment
- Perform core business functions (mowing, plowing)
- Must be on payroll, not 1099

**Subcontractors (overflow capacity): INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS**
- Provide services for specific projects or overflow
- Use their own equipment (or rent from Stone & Salt at market rate)
- Work for other companies
- Invoice Stone & Salt, not paid via payroll
- Must maintain their own insurance and business license

**Penalties for misclassification:**
If the IRS or Ohio determines that a worker classified as a contractor should have been an employee:
- Back taxes: employer share of FICA, FUTA, SUTA (can be 10-15% of wages paid)
- Penalties: 1.5-3% of wages paid
- Interest
- Workers' comp premiums (if injury occurred while misclassified)

**Safe harbor rule:**
If you consistently treat similar workers the same way, file required 1099s, and have a reasonable basis for classification (industry practice, attorney/accountant advice), the IRS is less likely to reclassify retroactively.

---

### 5E. Required Workplace Postings (Ohio)

**Federal postings (required in all workplaces):**
- Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) minimum wage poster
- Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) poster
- OSHA "Job Safety and Health" poster
- Employee Polygraph Protection Act poster

**Ohio state postings:**
- Ohio Minimum Wage poster
- Ohio Workers' Compensation notice
- Ohio Unemployment Compensation notice
- Ohio Civil Rights Act poster

**Where to get them:**
- Free: Download from US Department of Labor and Ohio Department of Commerce websites
- Or: Order a complete "All-in-One" poster kit ($25-$50) from a compliance vendor

**Where to post:**
- In a common area accessible to all employees (break room, equipment storage area, office)
- Posters must be visible and unobstructed

**Penalties for non-posting:**
- OSHA: up to $7,000 per violation
- DOL: up to $1,000 per violation
- Ohio: varies by violation

---

### 5F. Hiring Documentation (I-9, W-4, IT-4)

**For every new hire, collect within first 3 days of employment:**

**Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification):**
- Federal requirement, verifies employee is legally authorized to work in US
- Employee completes Section 1 on first day
- Employer completes Section 2 within 3 days, after reviewing acceptable documents (driver's license + Social Security card, or passport, or other List A/B/C documents)
- Retain for 3 years after hire or 1 year after termination, whichever is later
- NEVER submit to the government (keep in your files; only produce if audited by ICE/DHS)

**Form W-4 (Employee's Withholding Certificate):**
- Employee indicates filing status, dependents, and additional withholding
- Used to calculate federal income tax withholding
- Retain permanently in employee file

**Ohio IT-4 (Employee's Withholding Exemption Certificate):**
- Ohio equivalent of W-4
- Used to calculate state income tax withholding
- Retain permanently

**Other recommended hire paperwork:**
- Job application (if used)
- Offer letter (stating wage, position, start date, at-will employment status)
- Employee handbook acknowledgment (if you have a handbook)
- Direct deposit authorization
- Emergency contact information
- Equipment/vehicle assignment log (if applicable)

---

### 5G. At-Will Employment and Termination

**Ohio is an at-will employment state:**
Either the employer or employee may terminate employment at any time, for any reason (or no reason), with or without notice, EXCEPT:
- Termination cannot be for an illegal reason (discrimination based on race, religion, sex, age, disability, national origin, etc.)
- Termination cannot be in retaliation for protected activity (filing a workers' comp claim, reporting safety violations, whistleblowing)
- Termination cannot violate an employment contract (if one exists)

**Best practices for termination:**
- Document performance issues before terminating (written warnings, performance improvement plans)
- Apply policies consistently (don't fire one employee for something you tolerate from another)
- Never terminate in anger or haste (consult attorney if unsure)
- Provide final paycheck on last day of work (Ohio law requires payment within 15 days or next regular payday, whichever is earlier, but best practice is same-day)
- Conduct exit interview, collect company property, terminate access to systems

**Wrongful termination claims:**
Even in an at-will state, employees can sue for wrongful termination if they believe it was discriminatory or retaliatory. The best defense is documentation: if you can show legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for termination (performance issues, attendance, policy violations) supported by written records, you will likely prevail.

---

## 6. Regulatory & Licensing

### 6A. Ohio Landscaping License Requirements

**Good news: Ohio does not require a general landscaping license.**

Unlike some states (California, Florida, Louisiana), Ohio does not require contractors performing landscaping, grounds maintenance, or hardscaping to obtain a state-issued contractor's license.

**Exception: Nursery Stock Dealer License**

**When required:**
If Stone & Salt sells, installs, or delivers nursery stock (trees, shrubs, perennials, ornamental plants), it must obtain an Ohio Nursery Stock Dealer License.

"Nursery stock" includes any plants intended for planting, propagation, or ornamentation (excluding cut flowers, seeds, and vegetable plants).

**Cost:** $125 annually

**How to apply:**
Ohio Department of Agriculture, Division of Plant Health
[ODA Nursery Licensing](https://agri.ohio.gov/divisions/plant-health/nursery-licensing)

**Inspection:**
The Ohio Department of Agriculture will inspect your nursery stock storage/handling area to ensure compliance with pest and disease regulations. If you purchase plants from licensed nurseries and install them immediately (without holding inventory), the inspection is minimal.

**Does Stone & Salt need this?**
- **Yes, if:** Offering landscape installation services that include planting trees, shrubs, or perennials (even if subcontracted to a nursery)
- **No, if:** Only providing mowing, hardscaping (pavers, walls), and snow removal (no plant installation)

**Recommendation:** Apply for the license even if you do not plan to install plants in Year 1. It costs $125/year and signals professionalism. Many commercial property managers expect vendors to be licensed for any plant-related work.

---

### 6B. Pesticide/Herbicide Application Licensing

**When required:**
If Stone & Salt applies pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, or insecticides for compensation (i.e., as a paid service), it must obtain:

1. **Commercial Pesticide Applicator License** (for the company)
2. **Certified Applicator** (for the individual applying the chemicals)

**Ohio Department of Agriculture regulations:**

- **Categories:** Different licenses for different application types:
  - Category 3A: Ornamental and Turf (lawn fertilization, weed control, insect control)
  - Category 3B: Right-of-Way (roadside, utility corridors -- not applicable to Stone & Salt)
  - Category 6: Commercial and Institutional (interior pest control -- not applicable)

- **Exam required:** Pass the Core exam (general pesticide safety and regulations) + Category 3A exam (ornamental and turf-specific)

- **Cost:**
  - Exam fees: $35/exam (Core + Category = $70 total)
  - License fee: $35/year

**Exemptions:**
- **General fertilizer application** (non-pesticide fertilizers like 10-10-10, Milorganite, etc.) does NOT require a license in Ohio
- **Over-the-counter products** labeled for homeowner use applied on your own property do not require a license

**Does Stone & Salt need this?**
- **No, if:** Only offering mowing, edging, mulching, and basic maintenance (no chemical applications)
- **Yes, if:** Offering weed control, pre-emergent herbicide, insect control, or disease treatment as a paid service

**Recommendation:**
Skip pesticide licensing in Year 1 unless a client specifically requests it. Many commercial contracts exclude chemical applications (client hires a separate pesticide company like TruGreen or Lawn Doctor). If demand exists in Year 2, one partner can obtain the license and certification.

### 6C. Snow Operations — Local Regulations

**Salt application:**
Ohio does not require a permit or license for salt application on private property. However:

**Stormwater runoff compliance:**
Excessive salt application can violate stormwater discharge regulations under the Clean Water Act if runoff enters storm drains, waterways, or wetlands. Best practices:
- Use the minimum effective salt quantity (brine pre-treatment reduces bulk salt use by 30-40%)
- Avoid applying salt when temperatures are below 15°F (salt is ineffective and creates runoff)
- Do not apply salt near waterways, wetlands, or environmentally sensitive areas

**Municipal sidewalk clearing ordinances:**
Some Cincinnati-area municipalities require property owners to clear public sidewalks adjacent to their property within 24-48 hours of snowfall. If Stone & Salt is clearing sidewalks as part of a contract, verify the local ordinance's timeline to ensure compliance.

Examples:
- City of Cincinnati: Property owners must clear sidewalks within 24 hours of snow ceasing
- City of Blue Ash: 24 hours
- Liberty Township: No sidewalk clearing ordinance (unincorporated township)

This is the client's legal obligation, not Stone & Salt's, but if Stone & Salt is performing the service under contract, the contract should reference the local timeline.

### 6D. Vehicle and Equipment Requirements

**CDL (Commercial Driver's License):**

**When required:**
If operating a vehicle or combination of vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) exceeding:
- 26,001 pounds (single vehicle), or
- 26,001 pounds (combined vehicle + trailer)

**Typical landscaping vehicles and trailers:**
- F-250/F-350 pickup: 10,000-14,000 lbs GVWR
- 18-foot open trailer: 3,000-7,000 lbs GVWR
- Combined: 13,000-21,000 lbs (below CDL threshold)

**Conclusion:** Stone & Salt's typical truck-and-trailer setup will NOT require a CDL.

**Exception:** If hauling a very large load (e.g., tractor on a heavy equipment trailer) that pushes combined GVWR over 26,001 lbs, a CDL is required. For Year 1 operations, this is unlikely.

---

**DOT Number:**

**When required:**
Commercial vehicles operating in interstate commerce (crossing state lines) with a GVWR over 10,001 lbs must obtain a USDOT number.

**Does Stone & Salt need this?**
- **No, if:** All operations are within Ohio (intrastate)
- **Yes, if:** Crossing into Kentucky to service properties in Boone, Kenton, or Campbell counties (even if just a few miles across the river)

The service area identified in the research includes Kentucky counties. If Stone & Salt services properties there, a USDOT number is required.

**Cost:** Free to obtain, but requires compliance with FMCSA regulations (driver logs, vehicle inspections, etc.). This is administratively burdensome for a small operation.

**Recommendation:**
In Year 1, focus on Ohio-only properties to avoid USDOT requirements. If Kentucky becomes a significant revenue source in Year 2, obtain the USDOT number and implement compliance systems.

---

### 6E. Business Licenses (Municipal)

**Ohio does not require a state-level business license** for landscaping or grounds maintenance.

**Local (municipal/township) business licenses:**
Requirements vary by municipality. Common scenarios:

- **Liberty Township (home base):** No general business license required. Confirm with zoning office if operating from a home-based office (parking commercial vehicles/trailers at residence may require a home occupation permit).
- **City of Cincinnati:** No general business license. Specific industries (contractors working on public property, vendors in public spaces) require permits, but landscaping on private property does not.
- **Other municipalities (Mason, West Chester, Blue Ash, Loveland):** Generally no business license required for landscaping services on private property.

**Recommendation:**
Confirm with Liberty Township zoning office that you may park commercial vehicles and trailers at your residence if that is your base of operations. Some townships restrict this in residential zones.

---

## 7. Intellectual Property

### 7A. Trademark Search and Registration

**Name: "Stone & Salt"**

**Search scope:**
- **Federal trademark search:** USPTO TESS database (free online)
  - Search for "Stone and Salt" and "Stone & Salt" in:
    - International Class 44 (Landscaping services, lawn care, snow removal)
    - International Class 37 (Construction services, hardscaping)
- **Ohio state trademark search:** Ohio Secretary of State database
- **Common law search:** Google search for "Stone & Salt landscaping" to identify unregistered users

**Result as of this analysis:**
A quick TESS search shows "Stone & Salt" is not federally registered in Classes 37 or 44 for landscaping/grounds services. (Verified February 2026.)

There is a "Stone & Salt" food/restaurant concept in other states, but trademark rights are territorial and industry-specific. A restaurant in California does not prevent a landscaping company in Ohio from using the same name.

**Recommendation:**
1. **Conduct a professional trademark search** ($300-$600 via an IP attorney or trademark search firm) to confirm no conflicts.
2. **If clear, register the trademark federally:**
   - File via USPTO TESS (online)
   - Cost: $350 per class (Class 44 for landscaping, Class 37 for hardscaping = $700 total)
   - Timeline: 6-12 months for approval
   - Protection: Nationwide exclusive rights to "Stone & Salt" for landscaping/grounds services

**Why register:**
- Prevents competitors from using the same or confusingly similar name
- Allows use of ® symbol (enhances credibility)
- Protects brand investment (website, vehicles, marketing materials)
- Increases business value (registered trademarks are transferable assets)

**When to register:**
Not required before launch, but should be completed within the first 6-12 months of operation. File a "use in commerce" application after the business is actively operating and using the mark.

---

### 7B. Domain Ownership Verification

**Domain: stoneandsaltohio.com**

**Current status:** (Assumed registered based on website development references in prior documents.)

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] Domain registered in the name of the business entity (Stone & Salt Landscaping LLC), not a personal name
- [ ] Auto-renewal enabled (prevents accidental expiration)
- [ ] Registrar: reputable provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare)
- [ ] WHOIS privacy enabled (hides personal contact info from public WHOIS records)
- [ ] DNS managed securely (two-factor authentication on registrar account)

**Additional domains to consider:**
- **stoneandsalt.com** (if available) -- shorter, more memorable
- **stoneandsaltlandscaping.com** -- SEO value (includes "landscaping" keyword)
- **Defensive registrations:**
  - stoneandsalt.net, stoneandsalt.org (prevent cybersquatting)
  - Common misspellings: stoneandslat.com, stonensalt.com, etc.

**Cost:** $12-$15/year per domain

**Recommendation:**
Register the primary domain (stoneandsaltohio.com) under the LLC's name and enable auto-renewal. Defensive registrations are optional but cheap insurance.

---

### 7C. Protecting Brand Assets

**Logo, color palette, website design:**
These are protectable as "trade dress" (the overall look and feel of the brand), but trade dress protection is harder to enforce than trademark protection.

**Best practices:**
- **Watermark photos:** Any photos used in marketing should include a subtle "© Stone & Salt Landscaping" watermark to prevent unauthorized use.
- **Copyright your website:** Include a copyright notice in the footer: "© 2026 Stone & Salt Landscaping LLC. All rights reserved."
- **Register copyright for original creative work:** If you create unique marketing materials (brochures, videos, custom graphics), register them with the US Copyright Office ($45-65 per work). This is optional but strengthens enforcement rights.

**Social media handles:**
- Secure consistent handles across platforms:
  - Facebook: @stoneandsaltohio or @stoneandsaltlandscaping
  - Instagram: @stoneandsaltohio
  - LinkedIn: Stone & Salt Landscaping LLC (company page)
  - YouTube: Stone & Salt Landscaping (if video content is planned)

**Recommendation:**
Claim social media handles immediately, even if you are not actively posting yet. Handles are free and prevent competitors or cybersquatters from taking them.

## 8. Attorney Checklist

### 8A. What MUST Go to an Attorney Before Launch

These are items that carry significant legal risk if done incorrectly. Spend the money now to avoid $10,000-$50,000 in legal costs later.

| Item | Why Attorney Review is Critical | Estimated Cost | Timeline |
|------|-------------------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Operating Agreement** | Partnership disputes are the #1 cause of small business failure. A poorly drafted OA creates ambiguity that leads to deadlock, buyout disputes, and litigation. An attorney ensures the OA is enforceable and protects both partners. | $800-$1,500 | 1-2 weeks |
| **Commercial Grounds Maintenance Contract Template** | Ambiguous scope, missing exclusions, weak indemnification, or improper liability allocation can expose Stone & Salt to unlimited liability. Property managers' attorneys will review these contracts -- yours should too. | $600-$1,200 | 1-2 weeks |
| **Snow & Ice Management Contract Template** | Snow contracts carry the highest liability risk in the industry. Slip-and-fall claims regularly result in $100K-$500K settlements. The contract must clearly define triggers, service windows, liability limits, and documentation. | $600-$1,200 | 1-2 weeks |
| **Subcontractor Agreement Template** | Misclassification of employees as contractors, inadequate indemnification, or missing insurance requirements can expose Stone & Salt to tax penalties, workers' comp liability, and third-party claims. | $400-$800 | 1 week |

**Total attorney costs for contract review: $2,400-$4,700**

This is expensive, but consider the alternative:
- A single slip-and-fall lawsuit because the snow contract did not properly define liability: $20,000-$100,000 in legal defense costs (even if you win)
- A partnership dispute requiring dissolution and buyout because the OA was ambiguous: $15,000-$50,000 in attorney fees
- An IRS audit reclassifying subcontractors as employees: 10-15% of wages paid in back taxes + penalties

**How to find the right attorney:**
- **NOT a general practice attorney.** You need a specialist.
- **Look for:** Ohio business attorney with experience in commercial contracts, construction/landscaping, and partnership agreements.
- **Referrals:** Ask other landscaping business owners, CPA, or insurance broker for recommendations.
- **Cincinnati-area firms to consider:** Many small/mid-size business law firms in Cincinnati specialize in contractor and service business law. Search "business attorney Cincinnati Ohio" or "construction attorney Cincinnati."

**What to bring to the attorney:**
- The templates and frameworks from this document
- Your specific business structure (50/50 partnership, equipment contributions, roles)
- Examples of client contracts you have seen (if any)
- Questions and concerns about liability, risk, or dispute resolution

---

### 8B. What is Nice to Have (But Not Critical for Launch)

These are items that can be handled later or self-service with lower risk.

| Item | Can Self-Service? | When to Get Attorney Involved |
|------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| **LLC Formation (Articles of Organization)** | YES -- Ohio's online filing system is straightforward. Use the standard form. | If complex structure (multiple classes of ownership, silent investors, etc.) |
| **EIN Application** | YES -- IRS online application is free and instant. | Never (no attorney needed) |
| **Estate Mowing Agreement** | MAYBE -- Simpler than commercial contracts. Use a template from Nolo or Rocket Lawyer and customize. Risk is lower for residential. | If client pushes back on terms or you are unsure about any provision |
| **Employee Handbook** | MAYBE -- Use a template for Ohio employers. Keep it simple: at-will employment, anti-discrimination, safety policies. | If you grow to 10+ employees or have HR issues |
| **Trademark Registration** | MAYBE -- You can file a federal trademark application yourself via USPTO website. Many small businesses do this successfully. | If you want to maximize protection or face a complex trademark conflict |
| **Referral Agreement** | MAYBE -- Simple one-page agreement: referrer provides lead, Stone & Salt pays $X upon contract signing. Low risk. | If referrer is a business entity (landscape architect, real estate agent) and wants a formal agreement |

---

### 8C. Estimated Legal Costs Summary

| Phase | Item | Cost | Timing |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| **Formation (pre-launch)** | LLC Articles of Organization | $0-$200 (DIY or attorney-assisted) | Day 1 |
| **Formation (pre-launch)** | Operating Agreement (attorney review) | $800-$1,500 | Week 1-2 |
| **Contracts (before first proposal)** | Commercial Grounds Contract (attorney draft/review) | $600-$1,200 | Week 2-3 |
| **Contracts (before first proposal)** | Snow Contract (attorney draft/review) | $600-$1,200 | Week 2-3 |
| **Contracts (before using subs)** | Subcontractor Agreement (attorney review) | $400-$800 | Month 3-6 (when first sub is needed) |
| **IP (optional Year 1)** | Trademark registration | $700 (filing fees) + $500-$1,000 (attorney, if used) | Month 6-12 |
| **Total Year 1** | | **$3,100-$5,900** | |

**How to reduce costs:**
- Use the templates in this document as a starting point (attorney review of a draft is cheaper than attorney drafting from scratch)
- Bundle all contract reviews with one attorney (volume discount)
- Skip trademark registration in Year 1 if cash is tight (file in Year 2)

**Where NOT to cut costs:**
- Operating Agreement: DO NOT use a free online template without attorney review. This is your partnership's foundation.
- Snow Contract: DO NOT copy a competitor's contract or use a generic template. Snow liability is too high to DIY.

---

### 8D. Ongoing Legal Needs (Year 2+)

Once the core documents are in place, ongoing legal needs are minimal:

- **Contract disputes:** Rare if contracts are well-drafted, but budget $1,500-$3,000 if a dispute arises.
- **Employment issues:** If an employee files a discrimination or wrongful termination claim, budget $5,000-$15,000 for defense (hopefully covered by Employment Practices Liability Insurance if you add it in Year 2).
- **Lease review:** If you lease commercial space (shop, storage yard), have an attorney review the lease ($300-$600).
- **Partnership amendments:** If roles, ownership, or draws change, update the Operating Agreement ($300-$600 for an amendment).
- **Annual compliance:** File Ohio LLC annual report (if required -- verify with Ohio SOS) and maintain good standing.

**Recommendation:**
Establish a relationship with one business attorney in Year 1. Use them for all contract and partnership issues. Retainer relationships (pay $X/month for on-call advice) are available from some firms once you have steady legal needs.

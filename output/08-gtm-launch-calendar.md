## How to Use This Document

This is an execution plan, not a strategy deck. Print it. Kyle works from Section 1 today, Section 2 this week, and Sections 3-4 every Monday morning for the next 90 days. Every action has an owner, a deadline, and a specific deliverable.

---

## 1. Pre-Launch Checklist (February 15 - February 28)

Everything below must be done before any commercial outreach begins. Items are ordered by dependency -- what blocks what.

### Week of February 15-21 (THIS WEEK)

**BLOCKING -- Nothing else works without these:**

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Blocks | Status |
|---|--------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Get a real business phone number.** Port or purchase a 513 number through GHL. Set up voicemail: "Stone & Salt Commercial Dispatch. Leave a message and we will return your call within 4 hours. For snow emergencies, press 1." Route all calls to Kyle's cell. | Kyle | Feb 17 | Everything -- website, GBP, LSA, business cards, email signatures, all outreach | |
| 2 | **Form the LLC.** File online with Ohio Secretary of State ($99). Get the EIN from IRS.gov (instant, free). Open a business checking account (Chase or Fifth Third, same day with EIN). | Kyle | Feb 18 | Insurance, contracts, proposals, invoicing | |
| 3 | **Secure $2M GL insurance.** Call 3 commercial landscaping insurance brokers: (a) Cincinnati Insurance Company, (b) Westfield Insurance, (c) Erie Insurance. Request quotes for $2M GL + commercial auto + workers' comp. Target: bound by Feb 24. Budget: $3,000-$4,500/year, billed quarterly. | Kyle | Feb 21 (quotes); Feb 24 (bound) | Every commercial proposal, LSA application, vendor registration | |
| 4 | **Update all phone numbers on the website.** Replace every instance of (513) 555-0123 with the real number. The phone constant is in the codebase -- one change propagates everywhere. Deploy to Vercel. | Kyle | Feb 17 (same day as phone) | Website is not launchable with a placeholder number | |

**HIGH PRIORITY -- Must be done before outreach starts March 1:**

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| 5 | **Set up Google Business Profile.** Business name: Stone & Salt. Category: Commercial Landscaping Service. Service area: Liberty Township, West Chester, Mason, Blue Ash, Loveland, Indian Hill. Add all services, upload logo, add 5+ photos (truck photos, equipment, branded materials for now -- replace with job photos as they come in). | Kyle | Feb 19 | GBP must be live before LSA can be submitted. |
| 6 | **Submit LSA application.** Apply for Google Local Services Ads. Categories: Landscaping, Snow Removal. Upload insurance certificate, business license, EIN. Submit background check. LSA verification takes 3-4 weeks -- applying Feb 19 means live by mid-March at earliest. | Kyle | Feb 19 | Every day of delay pushes first LSA lead back a day. |
| 7 | **Set up GHL sub-account for Stone & Salt.** Create a new sub-account in the existing GHL Starter plan. Build the Prospect Pipeline (10 stages from operations doc). Create custom fields for commercial properties. Import the 20 named target companies from the customer acquisition research. Set up the local 513 phone number routing. | Kyle | Feb 21 | CRM must be ready before outreach begins. |
| 8 | **Purchase email domain for cold outreach.** Buy stoneandsalt.co or stoneandsaltgrounds.com (do NOT use the primary stoneandsaltohio.com for cold email -- protects deliverability). Set up in Instantly.ai. Begin domain warming immediately -- Instantly needs 14+ days of warming before sending. | Kyle | Feb 17 | Domain warming must start NOW. At 14 days, sending begins March 3. At 21 days (better), March 10. |
| 9 | **Order vehicle signage.** 2 trucks, professional vinyl lettering. Design: Stone & Salt logo, phone number, "Commercial Grounds Management | Snow & Ice | stoneandsaltohio.com". Use Slate + Eucalyptus + Sun-Ochre palette. Contact 2 local sign shops for quotes and turnaround (typically 5-7 business days). | Kyle | Order by Feb 19; installed by Feb 28 | Every mile driven is marketing. |
| 10 | **Order business cards and capability packets.** 500 premium business cards. Print 50 capability packets (4-page PDF: services overview, coverage area, insurance, Mike's Carwash reference, contact info). | Kyle | Order by Feb 19; receive by Feb 26 | Needed for IFMA/IREM events and door-to-door. |
| 11 | **Order uniforms.** 10 embroidered polos (Stone & Salt logo, Slate color), 5 embroidered hats. For Kyle, Chris, and future crew. | Kyle | Order by Feb 19; receive by Mar 7 | Professional appearance from Day 1. |
| 12 | **Set up Jobber.** Subscribe to Growing plan ($59/month). Create property templates for commercial grounds and snow. Set up GPS check-in/check-out workflow. Create visit documentation templates (minimum 2 photos per visit). Link to QuickBooks. | Kyle | Feb 24 | Must be operational before first service visit. |
| 13 | **Equipment check -- Chris.** Service all mowing equipment: oil change, blade sharpen/replace, air filter, hydro fluid check, grease all fittings, tire pressure. Inspect trailer: lights, brakes, ramps, tie-downs. Inspect plows, spreaders, Bobcat. List anything that needs repair or replacement. | Chris | Feb 21 | Equipment must be field-ready by March 1. |
| 14 | **Get commercial zero-turn mower quotes.** Contact 3 dealers for quotes on 60-61" commercial zero-turn: (a) Koenig Equipment, Lebanon OH (John Deere Z900 series), (b) nearest Exmark dealer (Lazer Z X-Series), (c) nearest Scag dealer (Turf Tiger II). Compare: price, warranty, financing terms (0% promo), service turnaround time. Target purchase: first week of March. Budget: $17,000-$18,000 with 0% APR/48 months. | Chris | Quotes by Feb 21; purchase decision by Feb 25 | Revenue tool -- cannot mow commercial lots without it. |
| 15 | **Establish tractor rental account.** Contact 2 rental sources for compact tractor (25-35 HP with loader) daily/weekly rates. Confirm they have availability in March-April. Budget: $135-$203/day for episodic estate and loader work. | Chris | Feb 21 | Backup for non-mowing work until tractor purchase is justified. |

## 4. Channel Strategy with Timeline

### 4A. Cold Email via Instantly

**Domain warming:** Started February 17. Fully warmed by March 3-10.

**Sequence structure (from brand audit):**
- Email 1 (Day 0): Pain Point Recognition -- "Managing 3 vendors for one property?"
- Email 2 (Day 4): Proof + Mike's Carwash -- "How Mike's Carwash solved the vendor coordination problem"
- Email 3 (Day 10): Urgency + Direct Ask -- "Spring capacity closing -- {{city}} area"

**Volume schedule:**

| Week | Emails/Day | Total/Week | Cumulative Contacts | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Mar 1-7 | 25 | 125 | 125 | First batch: all Tier A + Tier B |
| Mar 8-14 | 25 | 125 | 250 | Continue Tier B + start Tier C |
| Mar 15-21 | 20 | 100 | 350 | New prospects from property drives |
| Mar 22-28 | 15 | 75 | 425 | Focus shifts to follow-up over new sends |
| April | 10-15/day | 250-375/mo | 675-800 | New contacts from HOA research, IFMA, referrals |
| May | 10-15/day | 250-375/mo | 925-1175 | |

**Expected results (benchmarked):**
- Open rate: 35-45% (strong subject lines, local sender)
- Reply rate: 3-5% (commercial B2B cold email benchmark)
- Meeting booked from replies: 30-50%
- At 500 contacts: 15-25 replies, 5-12 meetings, 2-5 proposals, 1-2 contracts

**When to expect first replies:** Day 4-10 of sending (March 7-14). Most replies come on Emails 2 and 3.

### 4B. Cold Calling

**Call blocks:** Monday through Thursday, 10:00-11:30 AM and 1:30-3:00 PM. These are the highest-connect windows per the research (meetings booked cluster at 11 AM and 2 PM; Thursday produces the most bookings).

**Daily target:** 10-15 calls per block = 20-30 calls per day, 4 days per week = 80-120 calls per week.

**Script framework:**

**Gatekeeper:**
> "Hi, this is [Kyle] from Stone & Salt in Liberty Township. I'm trying to reach the person who manages landscape and snow vendors for your properties. Who would that be?"

**Decision-maker (first call):**
> "Hi [Name], this is Kyle from Stone & Salt. We're a commercial grounds management company based in Liberty Township. I'm reaching out because we specialize in year-round property management -- grounds maintenance and snow under a single contract. I know you're busy, so I'll be brief: I'd like to understand how you currently handle vendor selection for landscape and snow, and whether there's an opportunity for us to be considered. Do you have 2 minutes, or is there a better time for a quick call?"

**Voicemail strategy (leave on first attempt only -- do not leave repeat voicemails):**
> "Hi [Name], Kyle from Stone & Salt in Liberty Township. We provide commercial grounds management and snow removal under a single year-round contract. I'd like to learn about your vendor process. My direct number is [phone]. I'll also follow up by email. Thanks."

**Follow-up cadence:**
- Call 1: Leave voicemail + send email same day
- Call 2: 3 days later, no voicemail (let it ring)
- Call 3: 5 days later, leave voicemail only if email was opened (Instantly tracking)
- After 3 unreturned calls + 3 emails with no response: move to Nurture

### 4C. LinkedIn Outreach

**Profile optimization (Kyle's LinkedIn -- do before March 1):**
- Headline: "Owner, Stone & Salt | Commercial Grounds Management & Snow Removal | Greater Cincinnati"
- About section: 3-4 sentences about the vendor fragmentation problem and how Stone & Salt solves it. End with: "If you manage commercial properties in Greater Cincinnati and want one vendor who handles it all, let's connect."
- Featured: Link to stoneandsaltohio.com
- Experience: Stone & Salt, Owner (current)

**Connection strategy:**
- Send 5-10 personalized connection requests per day to property managers, facilities directors, and HOA managers in Greater Cincinnati
- Connection note (not a pitch): "Hi [Name], I run a commercial grounds management company in the Liberty Township area. I'd like to connect with local property professionals. No pitch -- just building my network."
- After connection accepted: wait 2-3 days, then send a brief message with value (not a sales pitch): "Thanks for connecting. I noticed you manage properties in [area]. If you ever need a backup vendor for grounds or snow, we're in the area and happy to help."

**InMail (for premium contacts who don't accept connections):**
- Use the same first-ask language from the Target Company List
- Research shows 65% of InMail responses arrive within 24 hours -- follow up with a phone call at 48 hours if no response

**Weekly LinkedIn targets:** 25-50 connection requests. 5-10 DMs or InMails. 1-2 relevant posts or comments per week (comment on property management industry content to build visibility).

### 4D. Google Local Services Ads (LSA)

**Application timeline:**
- Submit: February 19, 2026
- Verification complete (expected): March 14-19, 2026
- Live and generating leads: March 19+

**Setup:**
- Categories: Landscaping, Snow Removal (add both)
- Service area: 15-mile radius from Liberty Township (covers Mason, West Chester, Blue Ash, Loveland)
- Budget: Start at $50/week ($200/month). Increase to $100/week ($400/month) once lead quality is validated.
- Bid strategy: Manual bid, moderate position (not max -- maximize calls/messages)

**Lead handling:**
- Respond to every LSA lead within 30 minutes. LSA ranking is tied to responsiveness.
- First question on every call/message: "Are you calling about a commercial property or a residence?" This qualifies immediately.
- Commercial leads: schedule site assessment within 5 business days
- Residential leads: if within service area, quote maintenance or refer to hardscape pipeline. If outside service area, politely decline.
- Request Google review from every satisfied interaction (even residential). Reviews boost LSA ranking.

**Monthly budget ramp:**

| Month | LSA Budget | Expected Leads | Expected Commercial Leads | CPL |
|-------|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|-----|
| March (partial) | $100 | 3-5 | 0-1 | $25-$40 |
| April | $200 | 5-8 | 1-2 | $25-$40 |
| May | $500 | 12-20 | 2-4 | $25-$40 |
| June | $500 | 10-15 | 2-3 | $40-$60 |
| July-Aug | $400 | 6-10 | 1-2 | $60-$100 |
| Sep-Oct | $200 | 3-5 | 1-2 | $75-$100 |
| Nov-Feb | $200 | 2-4 | 0-1 | $100-$200+ |

### 4E. Google PPC (Non-LSA)

**Launch:** March 15, 2026 (bridge until LSA is live).

**Campaigns:**
1. **Commercial Grounds** -- keywords: "commercial landscaping Cincinnati," "commercial grounds management," "commercial property maintenance Cincinnati," "office park landscaping"
2. **Commercial Snow** -- keywords: "commercial snow removal Cincinnati," "parking lot plowing Cincinnati," "commercial snow contract" (activate September)

**Budget:** $500-$600/month in March-May (spring CPL ~$50/lead). Reduce to $200-$300/month June-August (summer CPL ~$100/lead). Pause or $100/month November-February (winter CPL $200+/lead -- not worth it).

**Landing pages:** Use commercial grounds page on stoneandsaltohio.com. CTA: "Request Site Assessment."

**Negative keywords:** residential, home, house, driveway, lawn care, yard, backyard, garden, flower

### 4F. Direct Mail

**What to send:** One-page capability sheet + cover letter. Printed on quality stock. Envelope: hand-addressed to named decision-maker. No mass-mail look.

**Who to send to:** All 20 named targets + any property management companies identified through prospecting. Target: 30-50 mailers per round.

**When:**
- Round 1: March 8-14 (20 mailers to Tier A + B)
- Round 2: April 1-7 (20 mailers to Tier B + C + new prospects)
- Round 3: May 15-21 (30 mailers to Nurture list with "Summer capacity update")
- Round 4: September 1-7 (50 mailers -- snow contract season opener, see Q4 section)

**Expected response rate:** 2.7-4.4% (DMA benchmark). At 50 mailers: 1-2 responses. Direct mail works best as a credibility amplifier when combined with email + calls, not as a standalone channel.

**Follow-up:** Call every mailer recipient 3-5 days after expected delivery. "I sent you a package about our commercial grounds management service. Did you have a chance to look at it?"

**Cost:** $3-$5 per piece (printing + postage + envelope). 100 pieces/year = $300-$500.

### 4G. IFMA/IREM/CAI Networking

**Which chapters:**
- IFMA Cincinnati Chapter -- facilities directors (your primary buyer)
- IREM Chapter 9 (Cincinnati/Dayton) -- property managers, real estate managers
- Community Associations Institute (CAI) -- HOA managers, board members

**Event frequency:** Monthly meetings for each. Attend at least 2 events per month (alternating IFMA and IREM). CAI as available.

**How to work the room:**
1. Arrive 15 minutes early. Introduce yourself to the event organizer. Ask: "Who should I meet tonight?"
2. Lead with curiosity, not a pitch: "What properties do you manage? What's your biggest headache with vendors right now?"
3. Exchange cards. Write a note on the back of every card you collect (what they manage, what they said, follow-up action).
4. Do NOT pitch at the event. Build rapport. The pitch comes in the follow-up.
5. Follow up within 24 hours: LinkedIn connection + email. "Great meeting you at [event]. I'd love to learn more about how you handle grounds management for your properties. Coffee or a quick call?"
6. After 2-3 events, offer to sponsor or present. Topic: "What Property Managers Should Demand from Grounds Vendors" or "Documentation Standards for Snow Liability Protection."

**Cost:** Membership dues ($200-$500/year per org) + event fees ($20-$50/event). Budget: $1,000/year total.

### 4H. Referral Program

**Structure:**
- $500 cash per signed annual commercial contract (grounds or snow), paid after first invoice clears
- For organizations with ethics policies (some PMs cannot accept personal payments): $500 charitable donation in the referrer's name to their chosen charity
- Residential hardscape referral: $250 per signed project over $25,000

**Who to seed it with:**
- Mike's Carwash contact (ask in March after first month of service)
- Every satisfied commercial client (ask at 90-day mark)
- IFMA/IREM contacts who are friendly but not prospects themselves
- Chris's construction network contacts
- Local real estate agents who manage commercial properties

**How to promote:**
- Physical referral cards: "Know a property manager who deserves better? $500 for every signed contract."
- Hand these out at quarterly reviews, networking events, and to every satisfied client
- Add a "Refer a Property Manager" section to the website

**When to ask:**
1. After the first "wins trust" milestone (first month of service)
2. After first successful snow event
3. During quarterly review meetings
4. At contract renewal time

### 4I. Vehicle Signage / Yard Signs

**Vehicle signage:**
- Order: February 19
- Installed: February 28
- Both trucks: Stone & Salt logo, phone number, "Commercial Grounds Management | Snow & Ice," website URL
- Every mile driven is a moving billboard in the service area

**Yard signs (commercial properties):**
- Do NOT place yard signs at commercial properties without explicit permission from the property manager
- If permission granted: small, professional sign at property entrance: "Grounds Managed by Stone & Salt | stoneandsaltohio.com"
- Order 20 yard signs in May once first commercial contracts are active
- Cost: $10-$15 per sign = $200-$300 for 20

| Google PPC leads | 5-10 | 0 (check campaign setup) |
| LSA status | Verified / going live | Still pending (call Google) |

### Weeks 5-8 (April)

|--------|--------|----------|
| Conversations started (cumulative) | 20-30 | <12 |
| Site assessments completed (cumulative) | 6-10 | <4 |
| Proposals sent (cumulative) | 5-8 | <3 |

| Hiring decision | Made | Deferred only if triggers not met |

### Leading Indicators to Track Weekly

Every Monday morning, Kyle reviews these numbers:

| Indicator | What It Tells You | Where to Find It |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Calls made this week | Activity level -- are you doing the work? | GHL activity log |
| Emails sent + opened | Outreach volume + message resonance | Instantly dashboard |
| New conversations started | Is outreach converting to engagement? | GHL pipeline Stage 3+ entries |
| Site assessments scheduled | Is engagement converting to opportunity? | GHL pipeline Stage 4 entries |
| Proposals sent this week | Are you creating opportunities to close? | GHL pipeline Stage 6 entries |
| Proposals aging >30 days | Are deals stalling? Need follow-up strategy? | GHL pipeline, filter by date |
| LSA leads this week | Is inbound working? | GHL + Google LSA dashboard |
| Response time (avg) | Are you hitting the 4-hour guarantee? | GHL communications log |
| Revenue collected this month | Cash position | QuickBooks |

### When to Worry

| Signal | What It Means | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| <10 calls per day for 2+ weeks | Kyle is spending too much time mowing and not enough on sales | Hire or reduce mowing load immediately. Sales is the bottleneck. |
| 0 site assessments after 200+ touches | Messaging is wrong or list is bad | Rewrite email subject lines. Switch to phone-first. Test different value propositions. |
| 5+ proposals sent, 0 in Negotiation after 60 days | Proposals are not compelling or pricing is off | Mystery-shop yourself. Ask a PM for honest feedback on the proposal. Review pricing against research benchmarks. |
| 0 new contracts by June 1 | **Kill criteria territory.** Commercial model is not working. | See financial model Section 11: Kill Criteria. Shift to residential hardscape + maintenance. |
| LSA generating leads but all residential | Commercial targeting is wrong | Add "commercial" to all LSA descriptions. Consider a separate "Snow Removal" LSA category. Adjust service descriptions. |
| Email reply rate below 1% after 200+ sends | Subject lines are weak or domain reputation is damaged | Test new subject lines. Check Instantly deliverability score. Switch to phone-first. |

## 6. Marketing Spend Allocation

### Monthly Budget Breakdown

| Month | LSA | Google PPC | Direct Mail | Networking (IFMA/IREM/CAI) | Referral Incentives | Content/Other | Total |
|-------|-----|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|---------------------|---------------|-------|
| **Mar** | $100 | $500 | $100 | $500 (membership dues) | $0 | $200 (vehicle lettering remainder) | **$1,400** |
| **Apr** | $200 | $600 | $150 | $50 (event fee) | $0 | $400 (direct mail printing) | **$1,400** |
| **May** | $500 | $400 | $150 | $50 | $0 | $300 (yard signs) | **$1,400** |
| **Jun** | $500 | $300 | $0 | $50 | $200 (first referral payment?) | $0 | **$1,050** |
| **Jul** | $500 | $300 | $0 | $50 | $200 | $0 | **$1,050** |
| **Aug** | $400 | $200 | $0 | $50 | $0 | $350 (snow season marketing prep) | **$1,000** |
| **Sep** | $200 | $400 (snow keywords) | $200 (snow mailers) | $50 | $0 | $0 | **$850** |
| **Oct** | $200 | $400 | $200 | $50 | $0 | $0 | **$850** |
| **Nov** | $200 | $200 | $100 | $50 | $200 | $50 (holiday cards) | **$800** |
| **Dec** | $200 | $100 | $100 | $50 | $200 | $150 (holiday cards) | **$800** |
| **Jan** | $200 | $100 | $200 | $50 | $0 | $250 (Year 2 marketing prep) | **$800** |
| **Feb** | $200 | $100 | $100 | $50 | $0 | $150 (pre-spring prep) | **$600** |
| **TOTAL** | **$3,400** | **$3,600** | **$1,300** | **$1,100** | **$800** | **$1,850** | **$12,050** |

### Seasonal CPL Expectations

| Season | CPL (LSA) | CPL (PPC) | CPL (Outbound) | CPL (Referral) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Spring (Mar-May) | $25-$40 | $50 | $5-$15 (materials only) | $0 |
| Summer (Jun-Aug) | $40-$60 | $100 | $5-$15 | $0-$500 (referral bonus) |
| Fall (Sep-Nov) | $50-$75 | $100 | $5-$15 | $0-$500 |
| Winter (Dec-Feb) | $75-$150 | $200+ | $5-$15 | $0-$500 |

**Strategy:** 60% of spend concentrated in Q1-Q2 when CPL is lowest. Winter marketing shifts almost entirely to outbound (no paid ads) and referral. This is why outbound infrastructure (calls, email, networking) is the primary engine -- it produces leads at $5-$15 regardless of season.

### Total Year 1 Marketing Spend: $12,050

This is 3.7% of the $325,000 revenue target, within the 5-10% industry guideline for aggressive growth. If revenue tracks below plan, reduce PPC spend first (highest CPL). Never cut outbound activity (lowest CPL, highest conversion for commercial).

## 7. Content Calendar

### Google Business Profile (Weekly)

Post on GBP every week. Google rewards active profiles with better visibility. Posts stay live for 7 days.

| Week | Post Type | Example Content |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Week 1 of month | **Service highlight** | "Spring cleanup season is here. Our commercial grounds team is booking site assessments for office parks, retail centers, and HOA common areas across West Chester and Mason. [Photo of crew on site]" |
| Week 2 of month | **Before/after** (when available) | "Before and after spring cleanup at [property, with permission]. One visit, one team, documented service. [Photos]" |
| Week 3 of month | **Trust signal** | "$2M liability coverage. GPS-documented service. 4-hour response guarantee. This is what commercial property managers should demand from their grounds vendor." |
| Week 4 of month | **Seasonal/local** | "Cincinnati's growing season is in full swing. Our crews are maintaining [X] commercial properties across Greater Cincinnati this week. [Photo of crew working]" |

**Photo strategy:** Every property visit, Chris takes 2+ photos in Jobber. Once per week, Kyle selects the best photo for GBP. Before/after comparisons perform best. Always get property manager permission before using identifiable property photos publicly.

### Blog Content for SEO (Monthly)

Target 1 blog post per month on the Stone & Salt website. Focus on long-tail commercial keywords. Each post should be 800-1,200 words, actionable, and written for property managers.

| Month | Topic | Target Keyword |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| March | "How to Evaluate a Commercial Grounds Management Vendor: The Property Manager's Checklist" | commercial grounds management vendor evaluation |
| April | "28-Visit vs. 32-Visit Landscape Contracts: What Cincinnati Property Managers Need to Know" | commercial landscape contract Ohio |
| May | "Why GPS-Documented Service Protects Your Property from Slip-and-Fall Claims" | snow removal documentation liability |
| June | "Summer Grounds Management: Drought Protocols for Cincinnati Commercial Properties" | commercial landscape drought management Ohio |
| July | "What to Look for When Your Landscape Contract Comes Up for Renewal" | commercial landscape contract renewal |
| August | "Pre-Season Prep: How Commercial Snow Contracts Should Be Structured" | commercial snow removal contract Cincinnati |
| September | "Fixed Seasonal vs. Per-Event Snow Contracts: Which Protects Your Budget?" | commercial snow contract pricing |
| October | "Budget Season Guide: How to Evaluate Year-Round Grounds Management" | commercial property grounds management budget |
| November | "Why Salt Prices Matter to Your Snow Budget (And How to Protect Yourself)" | bulk salt prices Ohio snow removal |
| December | "Year-Round vs. Seasonal Vendors: The Hidden Cost of Vendor Fragmentation" | year-round grounds management single vendor |

### LinkedIn (Kyle's Personal Profile)

Post 1-2 times per week. LinkedIn is the B2B channel for property managers.

| Type | Frequency | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Insight post** | 1/week | "Property managers: if your grounds vendor can't produce GPS-timestamped service logs for every visit, ask why. When a slip-and-fall claim hits, 'we were there' is not a defense. Documentation is." |
| **Engagement** | 2-3/week | Comment on IFMA, IREM, or commercial real estate posts. Add value, don't pitch. |
| **Photo post** | 1/week (when available) | Crew at work, equipment in action, before/after. "Our team at 6:30 AM this morning making sure [client]'s lot was cleared before anyone arrived." |

### Before/After Photo Protocol

Once commercial properties are in service:
1. Take a "before" photo during the site assessment (property condition under current vendor)
2. Take "after" photo at the 30-day and 90-day marks
3. Create side-by-side comparison images
4. Use on: GBP posts, LinkedIn, website case studies, proposal appendices, capability packets
5. **Always get written permission from the property manager before using photos publicly**

---

## 8. Q4 Budget Season Prep (September - November)

### Why This Section Matters

The customer acquisition research is explicit: Q4 is when commercial property managers set next-year budgets. Stone & Salt's Year 2 revenue is largely determined by what happens in September-November of Year 1. This section is your playbook for that window.

### August: Preparation Month

**Start date: August 1. Everything below must be complete by August 31.**

| # | Task | Owner | Deadline | Deliverable |
|---|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Build Year-in-Review one-pager.** Summarize Year 1 performance: properties served, visit count, average response time, client retention rate, service documentation stats (total visits logged, photos taken). | Kyle | Aug 15 | Branded 1-page PDF |

## 9. Milestone Checkpoints

### End of Month 1 (March 31): What Should Be True

| Checkpoint | Green | Yellow | Red |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----|
| **LLC formed, insured, operational** | Yes | In process | Not started |
| **Phone number live on website** | Yes | Yes but wrong number still somewhere | Still placeholder |
| **GBP live and verified** | Live | Submitted, pending verification | Not submitted |
| **LSA submitted** | Submitted, verification in progress | Submitted this week | Not submitted |
| **CRM set up with 20 targets loaded** | Yes, all Tier A-C | Partially loaded | Not started |
| **Cold email domain warming** | Complete (14+ days), sending | Warming in progress | Not started |
| **Cold emails sent** | 100+ | 50-99 | <50 |
| **Cold calls made** | 150+ | 75-149 | <75 |
| **Conversations started** | 8+ | 4-7 | <4 |
| **Site assessments completed** | 2+ | 1 | 0 |
| **Proposals sent** | 2+ | 1 | 0 |
| **Vehicle signage installed** | Yes | Ordered | Not ordered |
| **Zero-turn mower purchased** | In service | Purchased, in setup | Not purchased |
| **IFMA or IREM joined** | Joined + attended 1 event | Joined | Not joined |
| **Revenue** | $7,250+ | $5,000-$7,249 | <$5,000 |

**If mostly Green:** On track. Maintain pace. Focus on converting conversations to site assessments.

**If mostly Yellow:** Salvageable but behind. Double call volume in April. Identify what is causing delays and fix it.

**If mostly Red:** Emergency. Infrastructure is not in place. Stop everything else and complete pre-launch items. Every day of delay compounds.

### End of Month 2 (April 30): What Should Be True

| Checkpoint | Green | Yellow | Red |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----|
| **LSA live and generating leads** | Yes, leads coming in | Just went live | Still pending |
| **Conversations started (cumulative)** | 20+ | 10-19 | <10 |
| **Site assessments (cumulative)** | 6+ | 3-5 | <3 |
| **Proposals sent (cumulative)** | 5+ | 3-4 | <3 |
| **Pipeline value (Stages 6-9)** | $100,000+ | $50,000-$99,000 | <$50,000 |
| **New contracts signed** | 1+ | 0 (but 3+ proposals in review) | 0 (fewer than 3 proposals out) |
| **Google reviews** | 3+ | 2 | <2 |
| **Revenue** | $13,600+ | $10,000-$13,599 | <$10,000 |
| **Equipment operational** | All equipment field-ready | Minor issues being resolved | Major equipment not yet acquired |

**If Red on "New contracts signed" AND Red on "Proposals sent":** This is a leading indicator that the commercial model may not work at the projected pace. Do NOT panic yet -- but increase activity dramatically and begin accepting more residential work to maintain cash flow.

### End of Month 3 (May 31): What Should Be True

| Checkpoint | Green | Yellow | Red |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----|
| **New commercial contracts (beyond Mike's)** | 2+ | 1 | 0 |
| **Proposals sent (cumulative)** | 10+ | 6-9 | <6 |
| **Pipeline value** | $150,000+ | $75,000-$149,000 | <$75,000 |
| **Monthly revenue** | $17,000+ | $13,000-$16,999 | <$13,000 |
| **Cumulative revenue** | $38,000+ | $28,000-$37,999 | <$28,000 |
| **Google reviews** | 5+ | 3-4 | <3 |
| **First hire decision** | Made (hired or deferred with clear rationale) | Evaluating | Not considered |
| **LSA cost per commercial lead** | <$200 | $200-$400 | >$400 or no commercial leads |

**If Red on "New commercial contracts" at Month 3:** This is the first real decision point. Per the financial model kill criteria:
- If 0 new contracts after 3 months of active outreach: Increase hardscape volume immediately. Reduce partner draws. Extend the timeline to 6 months before triggering kill criteria.
- If 0 new contracts AND <$28,000 cumulative revenue: Serious risk. Consider shifting to residential-primary model. Commercial may take longer than projected.

### Kill Criteria Triggers (from Financial Model)

| # | Trigger | Threshold | When | Action |
|---|---------|-----------|------|--------|
| 1 | Zero new commercial contracts | 0 beyond Mike's Carwash after 6 months | Month 6 (August) | **PIVOT** to residential hardscape + maintenance |
| 2 | Revenue critically low | <$60,000 cumulative by Month 6 | Month 6 | **ASSESS**: inject capital, cut draws, take subcontract work, or wind down |
| 3 | Working capital depleted | Reserve hits $0 with negative cash flow | Any month | **EMERGENCY STOP**: cut all non-essential spend, take subcontract work |
| 4 | Quality failures | 3+ complaints or 2+ lost contracts in 3 months | Any quarter | **PAUSE GROWTH**: fix delivery before selling more |
| 5 | Partner disagreement | Irreconcilable within 30 days | Any time | **MEDIATE** within 30 days or trigger buyout |

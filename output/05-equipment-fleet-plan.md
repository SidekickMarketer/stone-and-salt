# Stone & Salt Equipment & Fleet Plan
## Commercial-Primary Year-Round Operations | February 15, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This fleet plan supports Stone & Salt's commercial-primary year-round grounds management business model. Equipment acquisition is structured in three phases tied to revenue milestones, balancing immediate operational needs with cash flow constraints inherent to the 3-6 month commercial sales cycle.

**Day 1 total investment: $22,500-$25,000** (with tractor financing)
**Month 7 expansion: $8,000-$12,000** (second mower)
**Year 2 expansion: $15,000-$35,000** (crew growth, additional equipment)

**Critical insight from deep research:** Commercial zero-turn mowers deliver 3.5 acres/hour vs. 2.0 acres/hour for tractor mid-mount decks. Over 5 years, the **time value difference** ($36,000 vs. $63,000 in operator hours) dwarfs the equipment price difference. For mowing-heavy routes, **buy the zero-turn first**. Use tractors for loader work, estate terrain, and multi-function capability.

**This business needs BOTH:**
- **Commercial zero-turn(s):** For flat commercial lots, retail centers, office parks (core revenue)
- **Compact tractor(s):** For estate mowing (hills, varied terrain), loader work, snow, hardscape prep
- **Trucks & trailers:** Day 1 requirement (already owned)
- **Snow equipment:** Plows, spreaders, Bobcat (mostly owned, gaps identified)
- **Hand equipment:** Full loadout by Month 1

## 1. Day 1 Fleet (March 2026 Launch)

### 1A. Mowing Equipment — PRIMARY PRODUCTION MACHINE

**DECISION: Buy ONE commercial 60-61" zero-turn mower first.**

| Equipment | Recommendation | Price Range | Financing | Where to Buy |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Primary Mower** | Commercial 60-61" zero-turn | $15,000-$18,000 new<br>$10,000-$13,000 used (2-3 yr) | 0% APR 48mo available | Koenig Equipment (Lebanon/Amelia OH)<br>Baxla Tractor (Seaman OH) |
| **Walk-Behind** | 36" commercial walk-behind | $3,000-$4,500 new<br>$1,800-$2,500 used | Cash or dealer 0% | Same dealers |

#### Top Commercial Zero-Turn Options (60-61" Deck)

**OPTION A: Scag Turf Tiger II 61" (Recommended)**
- **Price:** $17,099 sale price (MSRP $18,749) — verified dealer pricing Feb 2026
- **Financing:** 0% APR for 48 months available (in lieu of rebates)
- **Engine:** 40 HP Kawasaki
- **Warranty:** 2-year commercial machine warranty (Scag commercial policy)

- Warranty covers Years 1-2 (critical break-in period)
- Koenig Equipment is 25 minutes from Liberty Township (service proximity matters)

#### Used Alternative (Cash Flow Constrained)

If $17K is too aggressive for Month 1 cash flow:

**Used Commercial 60" Zero-Turn (2021-2023, under 500 hours)**
- **Target:** Scag, Exmark, or John Deere Z900-series
- **Price range:** $10,000-$13,000 (Facebook Marketplace, TractorHouse, dealer used inventory)
- **Hours target:** Under 300 hours ideal, under 500 acceptable
- **Where to find:** Koenig Equipment used inventory (Amelia location had 2021 JD 1025R listed at $19,495 — they turn commercial mowers too), Facebook Marketplace Cincinnati/Dayton searches
- **Risk mitigation:** Have a mechanic inspect before purchase. Commercial mowers under 300 hours are barely broken in.

---

### 1B. Tractor — MULTI-FUNCTION WORKHORSE

**DECISION: Buy ONE compact tractor with loader + 60" mid-mount deck.**

This is for:
- Estate mowing (hills, rough terrain, large acreage where zero-turn can't go)
- Loader work (mulch, materials, grading for hardscape prep)
- Snow season backup (if needed)
- Client differentiation ("We have the equipment for ANY property")

#### Top Compact Tractor Options (23-25 HP, Loader + 60" MMM)

**OPTION A: Kubota BX2380 Package (Best Value)**
- **Configuration:** BX2380 tractor + LA344 loader + 60" mid-mount mower deck
- **Price:** $21,665 (verified dealer quote: tractor+loader $18,790 + deck $2,875)
- **Financing:** **0% APR for 36 months, $0 down** (Kubota promo expires 02/28/2026 — ACT NOW)
- **Payment:** $602/month for 36 months (0% interest)
- **Specs:** 21.6 HP, 17.7 PTO HP, 680 lb 3-point lift, 1,443 lb weight
- **Warranty (Commercial Use):** 24 months/1500 hours basic, 36 months/2000 hours powertrain
- **Why this one:** Lowest total cost in class. Kubota BX is the most popular sub-compact tractor in North America for good reason — reliable, parts availability excellent, dealer network strong.
- **Where:** Baxla Tractor Sales, Seaman OH (verified Kubota dealer with BX pricing posted)

**OPTION B: Kubota BX2680 Package (More Power)**
- **Configuration:** BX2680 tractor + loader + 60" deck
- **Price:** $24,800 (verified dealer package price)
- **Financing:** Same 0% for 36 months
- **Payment:** $689/month for 36 months
- **Specs:** 24.8 HP, 19.5 PTO HP, 680 lb 3-point lift (same as BX2380)
- **Warranty:** Same as BX2380
- **Why this one:** More PTO power for heavy mowing or implement work. Worth the $3,135 upcharge if you're mowing heavy/wet grass or doing significant loader work.
- **Where:** Same Kubota dealers

**OPTION C: John Deere 1025R Package**
- **Configuration:** 1025R + 120R loader + 60D AutoConnect deck
- **Price:** $27,052 (verified dealer cash price, includes box blade)
- **Financing:** **0% APR for 60 months** (John Deere promo, verified Feb 2026)
- **Payment:** $451/month for 60 months
- **Specs:** 23.9 HP, 18.2 PTO HP, 758 lb 3-point lift, 1,556 lb weight
- **Warranty:** Standard JD compact tractor warranty (verify commercial use terms with dealer)
- **Why this one:** AutoConnect deck system is fastest attach/detach in the industry. JD dealer service network is best-in-class. Lower monthly payment due to 60-month term.
- **Where:** Koenig Equipment, Lebanon or Amelia OH

**RECOMMENDATION: Kubota BX2380 package at $21,665.**
- **Payment:** $602/month for 36 months at 0% (offer expires 02/28/2026)
- **WHY:** Lowest total cost, proven reliability, strong warranty for commercial use, dealer proximity
- **ALTERNATIVE:** If you can swing the extra $90/month, the BX2680 ($689/mo) gives more power for only $3,135 more total.
- **JOHN DEERE CASE:** Only choose the 1025R if Koenig's service reputation significantly outweighs the $5,387 price premium over BX2380. The $451/month payment looks attractive but you're financing for 60 months instead of 36.

#### Used Tractor Alternative

**Target:** 2021-2023 Kubota BX2380/BX2680 or John Deere 1025R, under 300 hours, with loader + mower deck included

- **Price range:** $15,000-$18,000 (verified: 2021 JD 1025R w/ 137 hrs listed at $17,500; Kubota BX units in similar range)
- **Where:** Facebook Marketplace (Cincinnati/Dayton), Craigslist Ohio, Koenig used inventory, TractorHouse
- **Hours sweet spot:** 100-300 hours. Sub-compact tractors are barely broken in at 300 hours.
- **Verification checklist:**
  - Service records (oil changes, maintenance)
  - Loader and deck MUST be included (buying separately adds $5,000-$8,000)
  - Inspect hydraulics (no leaks)
  - Test PTO engagement
  - Check for frame damage or abuse
- **Savings:** $3,500-$6,500 vs. new, but you lose the 0% financing offer and warranty coverage

**Decision:** If cash flow is tight, buy used and pay cash ($16,000-$17,000). If cash flow supports $600/month, buy new Kubota BX2380 at 0% and preserve working capital.

## 2. Mowing Equipment Deep Dive

### 2A. Why Commercial Zero-Turn FIRST, Tractor SECOND

From the deep research TCO analysis (research-equipment-tractors.md):

**Productivity Comparison (840 acre-cuts/year workload):**

| Machine | Mowing Speed | Annual Hours | 5-Year Time Value (@$30/hr) | 5-Year Equipment Cost | 5-Year TOTAL Cost |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Commercial 60" zero-turn | 3.5 acres/hr | 240 hrs/yr | $36,000 | $21,672 | $57,672 |
| Tractor 60" mid-mount deck | 2.0 acres/hr | 420 hrs/yr | $63,000 | $23,527 | $86,527 |

**The $28,855 difference** over 5 years comes almost entirely from operator time. When you're billing $150-$200/acre for estate mowing or running commercial routes on tight schedules, the zero-turn pays for itself in **time saved**.

**When to Use Each:**

| Property Type | Use This | Why |
|--------------|----------|-----|
| **Flat commercial lot** (office park, retail center) | Commercial zero-turn | Speed, maneuverability, cut quality, professional appearance |
| **Flat residential lawn** (under 2 acres) | Commercial zero-turn | Same reasons |
| **Estate with hills** (10-30 acres, varied terrain) | Compact tractor with 60" deck | Stability on slopes, traction in wet conditions, larger fuel tank (less refilling) |
| **Commercial property needing loader work** | Compact tractor | Mulch spreading, material staging, seasonal bed prep |
| **Any property where "professional mower" matters** | Commercial zero-turn | Client perception — zero-turns LOOK more professional than tractors |

**Real-world operational insight:** Most successful commercial lawn companies run **zero-turns for 90% of mowing** and keep ONE tractor for hills, estates, and loader work. The tractor is NOT the primary mowing machine unless the business is estate-focused.

For Stone & Salt's commercial-primary model: **Zero-turn is the revenue engine. Tractor is the versatility tool.**

---

### 2B. Deck Size Decision: 60" vs. 61" vs. 72"

| Deck Size | Best For | Speed | Maneuverability | Price |
|-----------|----------|-------|----------------|-------|
| **48-52"** | Residential tight yards | Slower | Excellent | $12K-$15K |
| **60-61"** | **IDEAL for commercial** | Fast | Good | $15K-$18K |
| **72"** | Large open acreage only | Fastest | Poor | $20K-$25K |

**Recommendation: 60-61" for Stone & Salt.**

- Wide enough to be efficient on commercial lots
- Narrow enough to fit through most gates (60" fits standard 5-ft gate)
- Best balance of speed and maneuverability
- Parts availability is best in the 60" category (most popular commercial size)

---

### 2C. Walk-Behind Mower (Essential)

**Purpose:**
- Gated backyards (zero-turn can't access)
- Tight spaces around buildings
- Slopes too steep for zero-turn
- Backup mower if primary is down

**Recommendation: 36" commercial walk-behind (hydrostatic drive)**

Top options:
- **Exmark Commercial 30 (E-Series):** $3,200-$3,800
- **Scag SW36A-14KH:** $3,500-$4,200
- **Toro TimeMaster 30":** $2,500-$3,000 (lighter duty, but acceptable for backup role)

**Decision:** Scag SW36A (matches brand with primary zero-turn, simplifies parts inventory).

---

## 3. Trucks & Trailers

### 3A. Primary Truck Assessment (EXISTING)

**Current fleet: 2 pickup trucks with plows (owned)**

Assumption: Both are 3/4-ton or 1-ton pickups (F-250/2500 class or F-350/3500 class) given they're already set up for plows.

**Gaps to address:**
- **Lettering/branding:** Both trucks need Stone & Salt vinyl lettering (professional appearance). Budget $1,200 for both trucks.
- **Truck bed toolboxes:** Secure storage for hand equipment, chains, straps. Budget $400-$800 per truck.
- **Backup camera/sensors:** If not equipped, add for safety (especially when towing). Budget $200-$400.

**No new truck purchase needed Year 1.** Re-assess at Month 9 if second crew is launching.

---

### 3B. Trailer Strategy

**Year 1 Need: ONE 16-18 ft landscape trailer**

**Specifications:**
- **Length:** 16-18 feet (shorter is easier to maneuver, longer holds more but harder to park)
- **Width:** 82-83 inches standard (matches truck width)
- **GVWR:** 7,000-10,000 lbs (holds zero-turn + tractor + walk-behind + hand equipment)
- **Deck:** Treated wood or steel mesh
- **Ramps:** Side ramps or fold-down gate (easier loading than rear ramps)
- **Brakes:** Electric brakes (required for 7K+ GVWR)
- **Tongue jack:** 2,000 lb capacity (easier hitching)

**Top trailer brands (new):**
- Big Tex (best value, 16 ft landscape model ~$5,500 new)
- PJ Trailers (slightly pricier, excellent build quality, ~$6,500)
- Load Trail (budget option, ~$4,500)

**Used trailer buying checklist:**
- **Frame:** Check for rust, cracks, bends (especially near axle mounts)
- **Axles:** Spin wheels to check bearings (should be smooth, no grinding)
- **Lights:** Test all lights (brake, turn, running)
- **Deck:** Wood rot or steel rust? (Wood can be replaced cheaply)
- **Title:** Must have clean title in seller's name

**Where to find used:**
- Facebook Marketplace: Search "landscape trailer" or "equipment trailer" within 50 miles of Cincinnati
- Craigslist Cincinnati: Same search
- TractorHouse.com: Filter by Ohio, used trailers

**Price expectation:**
- 2018-2021 Big Tex 16 ft: $3,000-$4,500
- 2015-2017 models: $2,500-$3,500

**RECOMMENDATION: Buy used 2018-2020 Big Tex or PJ 16-18 ft for $3,500-$4,500.** Save $2,000-$3,000 vs. new with minimal risk. Inspect carefully, replace deck boards if needed ($200-$400 in lumber).

---

### 3C. Second Truck Timing (Year 1 or Year 2?)

**Trigger: When second crew launches.**

From the financial model, second crew member is hired in **Month 5-6 (July-August)**, but they're working WITH the partners, not independently.

**Second independent crew forms:** Month 10-12 (if revenue supports) OR Year 2 Month 3-4.

**Second truck acquisition timing: Year 2, Month 3 (June 2027)**

**Why wait?**
- Year 1, both partners + 1-2 crew members can operate from 2 trucks (already owned)
- Second truck + second trailer = $25,000-$40,000 investment (only justified when second crew is running full routes)
- Cash flow in Year 1 is tight months 1-6; preserve capital

**Second truck spec (when the time comes):**
- Used 2018-2021 Ford F-250 or Chevy 2500 (3/4-ton minimum)
- Diesel preferred for towing + longevity
- 4WD (required for snow season)
- Crew cab (seats 4-5 for crew transport)
- Plow-ready (previous plow mount acceptable, or budget $1,200-$2,000 for plow setup)
- Target price: $25,000-$35,000 (used market)

---

## 4. Snow & Ice Equipment

### 4A. Current Snow Equipment (EXISTING)

**Owned:**
- 2 pickup trucks with plows ✅
- Bobcat skid steer ✅ (can push snow if needed)

**Assumed plow setup:**
- Truck-mounted straight blade or V-plow (standard for pickup plows)

---

### 4B. Salt/Ice Management Equipment (GAPS)

| Equipment | Purpose | Price Range | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Tailgate Salt Spreader** | Residential driveways, small lots | $400-$800 | **NEEDED by Oct 2026.** SaltDogg TGS03 or SnowEx SP-575 |
| **V-Box Spreader (truck mount)** | Commercial lots (higher capacity) | $3,000-$5,000 used<br>$5,500-$8,000 new | **NEEDED by Oct 2026 if 4+ commercial snow contracts.** Buy used first season, upgrade if demand warrants. |
| **Walk-Behind Salt Spreader** | Sidewalks, tight areas | $150-$300 | Chapin 80 lb broadcast spreader (Home Depot) |
| **Sidewalk Snow Blower** | Commercial sidewalks, walkways | $800-$1,500 | Ariens Deluxe 28" or Honda HSS724 |
| **Backup Plow Blade** | Downtime risk mitigation | N/A | Rent from United Rentals if primary plow fails |

**PRIORITY 1 (Buy by October 2026):**
- **Tailgate salt spreader:** $600-$800 (SaltDogg TGS03 is the industry standard, available at Tractor Supply Co., Northern Tool)
- **Walk-behind spreader:** $200 (Chapin 80 lb residential broadcast spreader works fine for commercial sidewalks)
- **Sidewalk snow blower:** $900-$1,200 (Ariens Deluxe 28" — available at Lowe's, Home Depot)

**Total: $1,700-$2,200** — budget this in Month 7-8 (Sept-Oct) before snow season.

**PRIORITY 2 (Buy if 4+ commercial snow contracts close):**
- **V-box spreader (used):** $3,500-$4,500
  - Where to find: Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, equipment auctions, municipal surplus auctions
  - Brands: Western, SnowEx, SaltDogg (any reputable brand, condition matters more than name)
  - Capacity: 1.0-1.5 cubic yard (sufficient for 4-6 commercial lots per fill)

**Skid Steer Use in Snow:**
- **Current Bobcat:** Can push snow with bucket or add a plow attachment ($800-$1,500)
- **When to use:** Large commercial lots (faster than truck plow for open areas), snow stacking, hauling
- **Limitation:** Slower travel between properties (load on trailer, transport = time-consuming)
- **Rent vs. Own:** For Year 1, use the Bobcat opportunistically. Rent a second skid steer ($250-$400/day) if a massive storm hits and you need more capacity.

---

### 4C. Salt Pre-Purchase Strategy (CRITICAL)

**From research:** Salt prices in Cincinnati are VOLATILE. Historical $67-$75/ton has spiked to $140+/ton due to river terminal closures and Cargill's exit from the local market.

**Mitigation:**
1. **Pre-season bulk purchase (August-September):** Buy 20-30 tons of bulk treated salt at pre-season rates. Lock in before October demand spike.
2. **Supplier options:**
   - **Butler County Engineer's Office vendor:** Awarded contract at $96.40/ton (May 2025). Contact vendor (public record) and ask about contractor pricing.
   - **Cargill alternatives:** Since Cargill exited, find local distributors carrying Morton, Compass Minerals, or regional brands.
   - **Where to call:** Kurtz Bros (Cincinnati), Sheaffer Mulch (West Chester), Vienna Materials (Cincinnati) — all sell bulk salt to contractors.
3. **Storage:** Need covered or tarped storage for 20-30 tons (approx 500-750 sq ft). Option: Rent a small storage unit or use a corner of a warehouse/barn.

**Budget:**
- 25 tons at $85-$100/ton (pre-season) = $2,125-$2,500
- Storage: $0-$300/month (use owned space if possible, or tarp on trailer)

**Contract clause (MANDATORY):** Every snow contract MUST include: *"Material costs based on $85/ton bulk salt rate. Actual costs exceeding $85/ton will be passed through at cost plus 10% handling."*

This clause protects margins if salt spikes to $140+/ton.

---

## 5. Hardscape Equipment

### 5A. Current Equipment (EXISTING)

**Owned:**
- Asphalt equipment (paver/compactor) ✅ (usable for hardscape base prep)
- Bobcat skid steer ✅ (essential for material movement, excavation, grading)

---

### 5B. Hardscape Gaps (RENT vs. OWN)

| Equipment | Purpose | Rent Cost | Buy Cost | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Plate Compactor (walk-behind)** | Compact paver base, small areas | $75-$100/day | $1,500-$3,000 new<br>$800-$1,200 used | **BUY used by Month 2.** You'll use it 10-20 times/year. Pays for itself after 10 rentals. |
| **Brick/Paver Saw (gas-powered)** | Cut pavers, retaining wall blocks | $100-$150/day | $2,000-$4,000 new<br>$1,000-$1,500 used | **RENT for Year 1.** At 4-6 hardscape projects, total rental cost $600-$900. Buy Year 2 if hardscape volume justifies. |
| **Mini Excavator (35 Series)** | Deep excavation, retaining walls | $250-$350/day<br>$900-$1,200/week | $40,000-$60,000 new<br>$25,000-$35,000 used | **RENT as needed.** Only buy if doing 15+ hardscape projects/year (Year 2-3 decision). |
| **Paver Roller (hand-guided)** | Compact pavers after installation | $50-$75/day | $1,200-$2,000 new | **RENT or buy cheap used ($400-$600).** Depends on project frequency. |

**YEAR 1 HARDSCAPE EQUIPMENT STRATEGY:**

**Buy:**
- **Plate compactor (used):** $900-$1,200 — buy in Month 2 before first hardscape project. Check Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or equipment auctions. Brands: Wacker Neuson, Multiquip, Bomag (any reputable brand).

**Rent:**
- **Paver saw:** Rent from Sunbelt Rentals, United Rentals, or Home Depot ($100-$150/day). For a 3-week project, rent for 4-5 days total (not consecutive).
- **Mini excavator:** Rent for 3-5 days per project ($900-$1,500/week). Total rental cost for 4 projects = $3,600-$6,000/year. Still cheaper than buying.

**Year 2 Reassessment:**
- If hardscape volume hits 10+ projects/year, buy a used mini excavator ($28,000-$32,000)
- If volume hits 15+ projects/year, buy a paver saw ($1,500 used)

## 6. Scaling Triggers — When to Add Each Piece

### 6A. Mowing Equipment Scaling

| Trigger | Equipment to Add | Price | Timeline |
|---------|-----------------|-------|----------|
| **10-12 weekly mowing accounts** | ALREADY HAVE (zero-turn + tractor) | N/A | Day 1 |
| **20-25 weekly mowing accounts** | Second commercial zero-turn 60-61" | $15,000-$17,000 | Month 7-9 (Sept-Nov 2026) |
| **35-40 weekly mowing accounts** | Second tractor OR third zero-turn | $15,000-$22,000 | Year 2, Month 4-6 |
| **50+ weekly mowing accounts** | Second crew fully equipped (truck, trailer, mower, hand equipment) | $35,000-$50,000 | Year 2, Month 9-12 |

**Detailed Trigger Logic:**

**Second Zero-Turn (Month 7-9, 2026):**
- **When:** Commercial grounds contracts hit 5-6 active + residential maint hits 12-15 accounts
- **Why:** One mower can handle ~15-20 accounts if tightly routed. Beyond that, you're pushing 40+ hours/week just on mowing.
- **What to buy:** Same model as primary (Scag Turf Tiger II 61") for parts/maintenance simplicity, OR step down to a mid-grade 60" ($12,000-$15,000 range) if budget is tight.
- **Financing:** If 0% is still available, finance it. Otherwise, pay cash from retained earnings (financial model shows $20,000+ cumulative cash by Month 7).

**Second Tractor (Year 2, Month 4-6):**
- **When:** Estate mowing clients hit 8-10 properties (currently plan is 15-25 Year 1, but some will be serviced by zero-turn on flat sections)
- **Why:** One tractor can handle 10-15 estate properties if routes are efficient. Beyond that, need a second tractor or risk turning away business.
- **What to buy:** Same Kubota BX2380/BX2680 model for fleet consistency.

| **Second independent crew (5+ total crew)** | Second truck + second trailer | $28,000-$40,000 | Year 2, Month 3-6 |
| **Third crew (8+ total crew)** | Third truck + third trailer | $28,000-$40,000 | Year 3 |

**Second Truck + Trailer (Year 2, Month 3-6):**
- **When:** Second crew is running independent routes (not just helping partners)
- **Truck spec:** Used 2018-2021 F-250/2500, 4WD, crew cab, diesel, plow-ready
- **Trailer spec:** Same 16-18 ft landscape trailer (buy another used Big Tex or PJ)
- **Total investment:** $25,000-$35,000 truck + $3,500-$5,000 trailer = $28,500-$40,000

| **YEAR 3 TOTAL** | | **$100,000-$135,000** |

---

## 8. Maintenance & Operating Costs

### 8A. Annual Maintenance Per Equipment Type

| Equipment | Annual Maintenance Cost | What's Included |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Commercial zero-turn** | $800-$1,200/year | Oil changes (3-4x/yr), air filters, blades, belts, grease, spark plugs. Spindle bearings every 500-750 hours. |
| **Compact tractor** | $600-$900/year | Oil changes (2-3x/yr), filters (oil, air, fuel, hydraulic), grease, PTO service. |
| **Walk-behind mower** | $200-$300/year | Oil changes, blade sharpening, belt replacement. |
| **Hand equipment** | $300-$500/year total | String trimmer heads, 2-cycle oil, spark plugs, air filters. Blowers and edgers similar. |
| **Trucks (2)** | $1,500-$2,500/year each | Oil changes, tires, brakes, fluids. Does NOT include major repairs. |
| **Bobcat** | $1,000-$1,500/year | Hydraulic fluid, filters, grease, bucket edge replacement. |
| **Trailer** | $100-$200/year | Wheel bearings, lights, tire replacement as needed. |
| **TOTAL (Year 1 fleet)** | **$6,000-$9,000/year** | |

**CRITICAL: Commercial equipment runs HARD.** Budget the high end of the range, not the low end.

**Dealer service vs. DIY:**
- **Dealer service:** Oil change on commercial zero-turn: $150-$200. Convenient but expensive.
- **DIY:** Oil change DIY: $40-$60 in parts, 45 minutes. Partners should handle routine maintenance (oil, filters, blades) and use dealer for complex repairs (hydraulic leaks, electrical, spindle replacement).

**Warranty coverage (Year 1-2):**
- Scag zero-turn: 2-year warranty covers major failures
- Kubota tractor: 24-month/1500-hour basic + 36-month/2000-hour powertrain
- Use warranty aggressively — don't pay out-of-pocket for covered repairs

---

### 8B. Fuel Costs

**Assumptions (from research):**
- Gasoline: $3.25/gallon
- Diesel: $3.90/gallon
- Commercial zero-turn fuel burn: ~1.2 gal/hour
- Compact tractor fuel burn: ~0.5 gal/hour (diesel)
- Trucks: ~12 MPG average (mix highway/city with towing)

**Annual Fuel Budget (Year 1):**

| Equipment | Annual Hours | Fuel Type | Gallons/Year | Cost/Year |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Primary zero-turn | 300-400 hrs | Gas | 360-480 gal | $1,170-$1,560 |
| Compact tractor | 150-200 hrs | Diesel | 75-100 gal | $293-$390 |
| Walk-behind mower | 50-75 hrs | Gas | 25-38 gal | $81-$124 |
| Hand equipment | N/A (2-cycle) | Gas + oil | 30-40 gal mix | $100-$130 |
| Trucks (2) | 15,000 mi total | Gas | 1,250 gal | $4,063 |
| Bobcat | 50-75 hrs | Diesel | 25-38 gal | $98-$148 |
| **TOTAL FUEL (Year 1)** | | | | **$5,805-$6,415** |

**From financial model:** Budgeted $14,400/year for "Fuel & vehicle maintenance" (combined). Fuel alone = $6,000, leaving $8,400 for truck/equipment maintenance. This is realistic.

**Fuel cost management:**
- Fill up at Costco or Sam's Club (10-20 cents/gal cheaper than gas stations)
- Buy diesel in bulk if possible (275-gal tank on-site can save 15-25 cents/gal, but requires $1,200-$1,800 tank investment + delivery setup)

---

### 8C. Insurance

**From financial model and research:**

| Coverage | Annual Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **General Liability ($2M)** | $3,000-$4,500 | Required for commercial contracts. Shop quotes from 3-5 insurers. |
| **Commercial Auto (2 trucks + trailer)** | $2,400-$3,600 | Covers trucks, trailer, equipment while towing. |
| **Inland Marine (equipment)** | $800-$1,500 | Covers mowers, tractor, hand equipment (theft, damage). Optional but HIGHLY recommended. |
| **Workers' Compensation** | $3,000-$5,000 | Ohio State Fund. Rates vary by payroll and classification. |
| **TOTAL INSURANCE** | **$9,200-$14,600/year** | Financial model budgets $12,000 — middle of range. |

**Ways to reduce insurance costs:**
- Bundle all policies with one insurer (10-15% discount typical)
- Install GPS tracking on trucks + equipment (5-10% discount on theft/recovery claims)
- Pay annually vs. monthly (saves 5-8% vs. installment fees)
- Increase deductibles ($1,000 vs. $500 deductible can save 10-15% on premiums)

**When to shop:** Get quotes in February (before March launch). Compare:
- Progressive Commercial
- State Farm Business
- Nationwide Agribusiness
- Society Insurance (landscaping specialist)
- The Hartford

---

### 8D. Depreciation Schedule (For Tax Planning)

**Section 179 Deduction (Immediate Write-Off):**

The IRS allows businesses to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment in the year purchased (up to $1,160,000 for 2024-2026, adjusted annually).

**Stone & Salt Year 1 Section 179 Opportunity:**

| Equipment | Purchase Price | Section 179 Deduction | Tax Savings (@25% rate) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Commercial zero-turn | $17,099 | $17,099 | $4,275 |
| Compact tractor package | $21,665 | $21,665 | $5,416 |
| Walk-behind mower | $2,000 | $2,000 | $500 |
| Hand equipment | $3,000 | $3,000 | $750 |
| Trailer | $4,000 | $4,000 | $1,000 |
| Plate compactor | $1,000 | $1,000 | $250 |
| **TOTAL** | **$48,764** | **$48,764** | **$12,191** |

**What this means:** If partners take Section 179 on all equipment purchased in Year 1, the business reduces taxable income by $48,764. At a 25% effective tax rate (federal + state), that's **$12,191 in tax savings** — essentially a 25% rebate on equipment purchases.

**Talk to accountant about:**
- Whether to take full Section 179 or spread via normal depreciation (depends on profitability and tax strategy)
- Bonus depreciation (additional deduction beyond Section 179)
- Vehicle depreciation limits (trucks have different rules)

## 10. Scaling Triggers Summary (Quick Reference)

| Client/Revenue Milestone | Equipment to Add | Investment | Timeline |
|-------------------------|------------------|------------|----------|
| **START (Day 1)** | Zero-turn, tractor, trailer, hand equipment | $12,200 cash + $958/mo | March 2026 |
| **First hardscape project** | Plate compactor (used) | $900-$1,200 | Month 2 |
| **20-25 weekly mowing accounts** | Second commercial zero-turn | $15,000-$17,000 | Month 7-9 |
| **4-6 commercial snow contracts** | V-box salt spreader (used) | $3,500-$5,000 | Month 8 (Oct) |
| **Second independent crew** | Second truck + trailer + mower | $43,000-$55,000 | Year 2, Month 3-6 |
| **10+ hardscape projects/year** | Used mini excavator | $28,000-$32,000 | Year 2, Month 6-12 |
| **35-40 weekly mowing accounts** | Third zero-turn OR second tractor | $15,000-$22,000 | Year 2, Month 6-12 |
| **10+ commercial snow contracts** | Dedicated snow truck + larger equipment | $35,000-$50,000 | Year 3 |

---

## 11. Critical Success Factors

### 11A. Don't Over-Buy Early

**Risk:** Buying too much equipment before revenue supports it locks up working capital and creates unnecessary monthly payments.

**Example of over-buying:**
- Buying TWO zero-turns Day 1 (only need one until 20+ accounts)
- Buying a NEW mini excavator before proving hardscape volume
- Buying a third truck before second crew exists

**Discipline:** Match equipment investment to **current** workload + 3-month forward projection. Not 12-month fantasy projections.

---

### 11B. Prioritize Service Network Proximity

**Why this matters:** A zero-turn that's down for 5 days waiting on parts costs $2,000-$5,000 in lost revenue (or rental costs). A dealer 10 minutes away with parts in stock is worth paying an extra $1,000 upfront.

**Koenig Equipment's advantage:** 4 locations in Greater Cincinnati, mobile service, large parts inventory. If your Scag or JD mower needs a spindle bearing on Tuesday morning, they can have it by Tuesday afternoon.

**Dealer service questions to ask BEFORE buying:**
- What's your typical parts turnaround for commercial mowers? (Answer should be "same day" or "next day" for common parts)
- Do you stock belts, blades, spindles for this model? (Answer should be "yes")
- Do you have a mobile service truck? (For commercial customers, this is huge)
- What's your service bay backlog during peak season? (If they say "2-3 weeks," run away)

---

### 11C. Maintenance = Uptime = Revenue

**The math:** A commercial zero-turn that's properly maintained runs 300-500 hours/year for 5+ years. A neglected zero-turn needs a $3,000 rebuild at 800 hours and fails mid-season.

**Maintenance discipline:**
- **Daily:** Grease zerks, check tire pressure, clean deck, check oil
- **Every 50 hours:** Oil change, air filter, sharpen blades
- **Every 100 hours:** Replace blades, check belts, grease all fittings
- **Every 250 hours:** Hydraulic filter, spark plugs, detailed inspection
- **Off-season:** Full service, replace wear parts (belts, blades, filters), touch up paint, store properly

**Delegate or DIY?**
- **Partners should handle:** Daily grease, oil changes, blade changes, basic repairs
- **Dealer should handle:** Hydraulic issues, electrical problems, engine rebuilds, warranty work

**Maintenance budget reality check:** Financial model budgets $6,000-$9,000/year for all equipment maintenance. At 2-3 mowers + tractor + trucks + Bobcat, that's realistic IF partners do 60-70% of routine work. If you send everything to the dealer, budget $12,000-$15,000/year.

   - Landscape trailer: Search "landscape trailer" or "equipment trailer," 16-18 ft, $3,500-$4,500 target
   - Hand equipment: Mix of new (Stihl dealer for blowers/trimmers) and used (chainsaw, hedge trimmer, edger)

6. **Order:**
   - Truck lettering: Get quotes from local sign shops (FastSigns, SignsNow, or local vinyl shops), $500-$700 per truck
   - Toolboxes: Tractor Supply Co., Northern Tool, or Amazon (Weather Guard brand)

**WEEK 3-4 (March 8-31):**

7. **Take delivery:**
   - Zero-turn and tractor arrive (dealers deliver for free or small fee)
   - Inspect before signing (no damage, all accessories included, manuals provided)
   - Get dealer to walk you through maintenance schedule and warranty coverage

8. **Break-in period:**
   - First 50 hours on new mower: Check oil frequently, don't run at full throttle entire time, grease daily
   - First 50 hours on tractor: Same — new engines need gentle break-in

### 13B. What NOT to Buy Year 1

**Equipment to AVOID buying in Year 1:**

- ❌ **Mini excavator** — Rent for $900-$1,200/week as needed. At 4-6 hardscape projects, total rental cost is $3,600-$6,000 — still cheaper than $30,000-$35,000 purchase.
- ❌ **Second truck** — Current 2 trucks cover 1-4 crew members. Only buy when second independent crew launches (Year 2).
- ❌ **72" zero-turn** — 60-61" handles all commercial properties in Year 1. 72" is only useful for massive open acreage (rare in Cincinnati commercial market).
- ❌ **Enclosed trailer** — Open trailer is fine for Year 1. Enclosed adds $8,000-$15,000 and only matters for theft prevention or winter storage (not critical yet).
- ❌ **New paver saw** — Rent for $100-$150/day. At 4-6 projects, total rental cost is $600-$900. Buy Year 2 if hardscape volume justifies.
- ❌ **Pickup bed dump insert** — Nice-to-have for mulch jobs, but not essential. Wheelbarrow + Bobcat handles materials just fine.

### 13C. The Honest Assessment

**Can Stone & Salt launch with $12,200 cash + $958/month in equipment financing?**

**Yes.** This equipment package supports:
- 15-25 weekly mowing accounts (mix commercial + residential)
- 4-6 hardscape projects/year (with rented excavator/saw)
- 4-8 commercial snow removal contracts (with added salt spreaders in Month 7)

**Is this the "perfect" fleet?**

No. A "perfect" fleet would have:
- Two zero-turns (for faster mowing routes)
- Two tractors (for estate mowing flexibility)
- Mini excavator (for hardscape efficiency)
- Enclosed trailer (for security/branding)

But "perfect" costs $90,000-$120,000 upfront, and Stone & Salt's cash flow model can't support that in Months 1-6.

**The smart strategy:** Buy the MINIMUM equipment to serve clients excellently, then scale equipment investments in lockstep with revenue growth. Equipment sitting idle is cash that could be in the bank, paying partners, or funding marketing.

**Follow the triggers in Section 10.** When you hit 20-25 weekly accounts, buy the second zero-turn. When you hit 4+ commercial snow contracts, buy the V-box spreader. When you hit 10+ hardscape projects, buy the excavator.

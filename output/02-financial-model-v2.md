# Stone & Salt Financial Model v2
## Corrected with Deep Research Data | February 15, 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This is the corrected financial model for Stone & Salt, a commercial-primary year-round grounds management company serving Greater Cincinnati's northern suburbs. It replaces v1 by incorporating deep research findings on equipment TCO, validated salt pricing, seasonal marketing economics, and a complete fleet buildout plan.

**Key numbers:**

| Metric | v1 (Previous) | v2 (Corrected) | Change |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Year 1 revenue target | $325,000 | $325,000 | No change |
| Break-even month | Month 7 (exec summary) / Month 5 (table) | Month 5 (July) cumulative positive | Resolved inconsistency |
| First positive cash flow month | Month 3 | Month 3 (May) | Confirmed |
| Total startup capital (with financing) | ~$50,000 | ~$62,000 | +$12,000 |
| Total startup capital (all cash) | ~$67,000 | ~$85,000 | +$18,000 |
| Year 1 net operating income | $106,500 | $82,700 | -$23,800 |
| Partner income (each, Year 1) | $37,500 | $28,850 | -$8,650 |
| Year 1 retained earnings | $31,500 | $25,000 | -$6,500 |

**What changed and why:**

1. **Equipment is now a fleet, not a single machine.** The model now budgets for a commercial 60" zero-turn mower ($17,100) as the primary revenue tool AND a sub-compact tractor ($21,700-$27,200) for estate hills, loader work, and snow. Plus trucks, trailers, and full hand equipment loadout. Total equipment budget: $28,600 (Day 1) + fleet scaling in Year 2-3.
2. **Salt baseline corrected to $96.40/ton** from Butler County procurement (May 2025), not the $75/ton used in v1. This reduces snow margins by ~$600 per contract.
3. **Marketing spend is now seasonal.** $50/lead spring, $100 summer, $200+ winter. 60% of annual spend concentrated in Q1-Q2 when CPL is lowest.
4. **LSA verification delay of 3-4 weeks built into the timeline.** Month 1-2 inbound comes from outreach only; LSA leads start Month 3.
5. **Fleet scaling triggers defined.** When to add a second zero-turn, second tractor, second truck, and plow setup.

**Path to profitability:** Monthly costs exceed revenue in Months 1-2 (March-April). Month 3 (May) is the first positive cash flow month. Cumulative cash position turns positive in Month 5 (July). The maximum cumulative cash deficit is -$14,200 reached in Month 2.

## 2. Equipment & Fleet Plan

### 2A. The Fleet Philosophy

Stone & Salt requires TWO types of mowing equipment operating in parallel:

- **Commercial zero-turn mowers** for flat commercial grounds (office parks, retail centers, corporate campuses). These mow at 3.5 acres/hour vs. 2.0 acres/hour for tractors -- saving 180 hours/year on a 20-property workload. (Source: research-equipment-tractors.md, TCO analysis)
- **Compact tractors with mower decks** for estate mowing (hills, rough terrain, large residential lots where zero-turns are unsafe or ineffective) and for loader/implement work (mulch delivery, grading, snow pushing).

The v1 model assumed one piece of equipment (a used tractor). That was wrong. This model plans for a fleet that scales with contract count.

### 2B. Day 1 Equipment (March 2026)

| Item | Spec | New/Used | Cost | Financing | Monthly Payment | Source |
|------|------|----------|------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Commercial zero-turn mower** | Scag Turf Tiger II 61" or equivalent | New (dealer sale) | $17,100 | 0% APR / 48 months (dealer promo) | $356/mo | research-equipment-tractors.md: Scag MSRP $18,749, dealer sale $17,099 |
| **Pickup truck #1** | Existing -- 3/4 ton with plow mount | Owned | $0 | N/A | $0 | CONCEPT-BRIEF.md: 2 pickup trucks with plows owned |
| **Pickup truck #2** | Existing -- 1/2 or 3/4 ton with plow mount | Owned | $0 | N/A | $0 | CONCEPT-BRIEF.md: 2 pickup trucks with plows owned |
| **Bobcat skid steer** | Existing | Owned | $0 | N/A | $0 | CONCEPT-BRIEF.md: Bobcat owned |
| **Open utility trailer** | 16-18ft tandem axle, used | Used | $4,000 | Cash | $0 | Standard market pricing for used landscape trailers |
| **Hand equipment package** | See detail below | New/Mix | $3,500 | Cash | $0 | Itemized below |
| **Fuel/salt spreader** | Tailgate-mount V-box spreader, used | Used | $2,500 | Cash | $0 | Used commercial spreader market |
| **Misc startup (blades, filters, oil, safety)** | Spare parts kit for zero-turn | New | $1,500 | Cash | $0 | Belts, spindles, blades, hydro filters |
| **TOTAL DAY 1** | | | **$28,600** | | **$356/mo** | |

**Hand equipment package detail:**

| Item | Qty | Unit Cost | Total |
|------|-----|-----------|-------|
| Commercial string trimmer (Stihl FS 131 or equivalent) | 2 | $430 | $860 |
| Backpack blower (Stihl BR 800 or equivalent) | 2 | $550 | $1,100 |
| Stick edger (Stihl FC 91 or equivalent) | 1 | $350 | $350 |
| Hedge trimmer (Stihl HL 94 or equivalent) | 1 | $400 | $400 |
| Hand tools (rakes, shovels, wheelbarrow, brooms) | Lot | $400 | $400 |
| Safety equipment (ear pro, eye pro, gloves, vests) | Lot | $200 | $200 |
| Fuel cans, mix oil, chain lube, etc. | Lot | $190 | $190 |
| **Total** | | | **$3,500** |

**Why no tractor on Day 1:** The deep research TCO analysis shows a commercial zero-turn is the better first machine for a mowing-heavy startup. Zero-turn mowing at 3.5 acres/hour vs. tractor at 2.0 acres/hour saves ~180 hours/year on a 20-property workload. At $30/hour loaded operator cost, that is $5,400/year in recovered time. For the first 3-6 months, tractor work (estate hills, loader jobs) can be handled by renting a compact tractor at $135-$203/day when needed. (Source: research-equipment-tractors.md, rental rates from published sources)

**Tractor rental budget (Months 1-6):** 12 rental days at $175/day average = $2,100. This covers approximately 2 rental days per month for estate-specific jobs while demand is validated.

### 2C. Mid-Year 1 Addition (Month 6-8, August-October 2026)

**Trigger:** When estate mowing clients exceed 8 AND/OR non-mowing loader work exceeds 3 days/month for 2 consecutive months.

| Item | Spec | New/Used | Cost | Financing | Monthly Payment | Source |
|------|------|----------|------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Sub-compact tractor + loader + 60" deck** | Kubota BX2380 package or JD 1025R | New with promo financing | $21,700-$24,800 | 0% APR / 36 months (Kubota promo) or 0% / 60 months (JD) | $450-$517/mo (36mo Kubota) or $362-$413/mo (60mo JD) | research-equipment-tractors.md: Kubota BX2380 dealer quote $21,665; BX2680 package $24,800; JD 1025R package $27,052 |

**Alternative: Buy used.** A 2-3 year old JD 1025R or Kubota BX2380 with loader and 60" deck, under 300 hours, runs $15,000-$19,500 in the Cincinnati market. (Source: RESEARCH-EQUIPMENT-COMPETITORS-RESULTS.md: dealer listing 2021 JD 1025R at $19,495; Craigslist JD 1025R w/loader+deck at $13,500; marketplace range $12,000-$18,000)

**Decision math (buy new vs. used):**

| Path | Price | Financing | 3-Year TCO (equip only) | Warranty |
|------|-------|-----------|------------------------|----------|
| New Kubota BX2380 package | $21,665 | 0% / 36mo, $602/mo | $14,766 (incl. resale) | 36mo/2000hr powertrain (commercial) |
| New JD 1025R package | $27,052 | 0% / 60mo, $451/mo | $16,130 (incl. resale) | Standard + 0% promo |
| Used JD 1025R (2-3yr, <300hr) | $17,000 | Cash or standard rate | ~$13,000 (lower resale) | No warranty |

**Recommendation:** If financing is available at 0%, buy new Kubota BX2380 for $21,665 and preserve cash. If cash is tight, buy used for $15,000-$17,000 and accept the warranty risk with a $2,000 repair contingency fund.

### 2D. Year 1 Snow Season Setup (Month 7-8, September-October 2026)

| Item | Spec | Status | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|--------|------|-------|
| Truck-mounted plow #1 | Existing on truck #1 | Owned | $0 | Already equipped |
| Truck-mounted plow #2 | Existing on truck #2 | Owned | $0 | Already equipped |
| Tailgate V-box salt spreader | Purchased Day 1 (see above) | Owned | $0 | Already in fleet |
| Bobcat with pusher attachment | Existing Bobcat + rent/buy pusher | $1,500-$3,000 | Buy used pusher box ($1,500) or new ($3,000) | For large commercial lots |
| Ice scraper/sidewalk equipment | Shovels, ice melt spreaders, calcium chloride | $500 | Lot price | Sidewalk crew tools |
| Bulk salt pre-purchase | 25 tons at pre-season rate | ~$2,400 | At $96/ton (Butler County baseline) | Lock pricing before winter |
| Liquid brine tank + sprayer | 200-gallon tank, 12V pump, spray bar | $1,800-$2,500 | Optional Year 1 | Reduces salt usage 30-40%; ROI positive if salt exceeds $120/ton |
| **Snow Season Setup Total** | | | **$4,400-$6,000** | |

### 2E. Year 2 Fleet Scaling Triggers and Additions

| Trigger | Addition | Est. Cost | Financing |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Commercial grounds contracts exceed 10 | 2nd commercial zero-turn mower (60"+) | $15,000-$17,000 | 0% promo if available, or used |
| Estate clients exceed 15 | 2nd tractor or larger tractor (L-series) | $25,000-$35,000 | Dealer financing |
| Crew count reaches 4+ | 3rd truck (1/2 ton, no plow needed for grounds crew) | $15,000-$25,000 used | Cash or standard auto loan |
| Snow contracts exceed 8 | Dedicated snow truck (plow + spreader) | $20,000-$30,000 used | Standard financing |
| Route density requires split crews | 2nd open trailer | $3,000-$4,000 used | Cash |
| Hardscape volume justifies | Enclosed trailer (equipment security + storage) | $6,000-$10,000 | Cash or finance |

### 2F. Year 3 Fleet Projection

| Asset | Qty | Purpose |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Commercial zero-turn mowers | 2-3 | Two grounds crews + backup |
| Sub-compact tractors | 1-2 | Estate mowing + loader work |
| Pickup trucks | 3-4 | Crew transport + plowing |
| Open trailers | 2-3 | Equipment transport per crew |
| Enclosed trailer | 0-1 | Equipment security (if needed) |
| Bobcat skid steer | 1 | Snow + hardscape + grading |
| V-box salt spreaders | 2 | Two salt routes |
| Bobcat pusher | 1 | Large lot clearing |
| Brine system | 1 | Pre-treatment + reduced salt use |

### 2G. Buy vs. Lease vs. Rent Decision Framework

| Situation | Recommendation | Math |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| Primary mowing equipment (zero-turn) | **Buy (finance at 0%)** | Revenue-critical, used 800+ hours/year. 0% financing preserves cash. Rental at $120/day x 200 days = $24,000/year vs. $356/month financed = $4,272/year. Buying is 5.6x cheaper. |
| Tractor (Year 1, before validation) | **Rent until utilization justifies purchase** | At $175/day, 12 days of rental = $2,100. If you'd use a tractor 20+ days/year, buying makes sense. If under 15 days, renting wins. |
| Tractor (Year 1, after validation) | **Buy (finance at 0% if available)** | Once estate clients exceed 8, tractor use exceeds 40 days/year. $175/day x 40 = $7,000/year rental vs. $450-$602/month financed = $5,400-$7,224/year. Buying wins on cost AND availability certainty. |
| Trucks | **Own** | Already owned. Replacements buy used with standard auto loans. |
| Trailers | **Buy (cash)** | Low cost, no financing overhead, always needed. |
| Specialized equipment (stump grinder, aerator, dethatcher) | **Rent** | Episodic use. $150-$300/day rental is far cheaper than owning. |
| Backup mower during downtime | **Rent** | $120/day for 2-3 days/year. Zero-turn rental sources identified: $119.99/day, $439.99/week (research-equipment-tractors.md). |

## 3. Revenue Model

### 3A. Revenue Sources and Annual Targets

| Revenue Source | Year 1 Target | # Contracts/Projects | Avg Value | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Commercial grounds maintenance** | $120,000 | 6-8 contracts | $15,000-$20,000/yr ($1,250-$1,667/mo) | Ramps from 1 (Mike's Carwash) to 8 over 12 months. Pricing validated at $800-$1,600/acre/month full-service. (research-pricing-validation.md) |
| **Commercial snow removal** | $65,000 | 4-6 seasonal contracts + per-push overflow | $10,000-$15,000/season | Seasonal Oct-Mar. Cincinnati averages 15-23"/year. Seasonal contracts pay regardless of snowfall. Per-push overflow adds $2K-$15K depending on winter. |
| **Estate mowing (residential)** | $40,000 | 10-15 clients | $3,000-$5,000/season ($150-$200/acre, 1.5-3 acres, 28 visits) | Tractor-served. Validated pricing: ~$80-$150/acre standard, $150-$200/acre estate premium. (RESEARCH-SUMMARY.md) |
| **Residential hardscape** | $60,000 | 2-3 projects | $25,000-$35,000 avg | Bridge revenue during commercial sales cycle. 50% deposit / 50% completion. Reduced from v1's 4-6 projects -- more conservative with 2-person crew capacity. |
| **Residential maintenance** | $40,000 | 10-12 accounts | $350/mo avg, 9 active months | Route density filler. Grows from 5 in Month 1 to 10-12 by Month 6. |
| **TOTAL** | **$325,000** | | | |

**Changes from v1:**
- Estate mowing broken out as a separate line ($40,000) -- previously lumped into commercial grounds and residential maintenance.
- Hardscape reduced from $91,000 to $60,000 -- more realistic with a 2-person crew handling commercial + estate + residential.
- Residential maintenance reduced from $49,000 to $40,000 to account for estate mowing as separate line.
- Commercial grounds and snow unchanged.

### 3B. Monthly Revenue Ramp

| Month | Month # | Commercial Grounds | Estate Mowing | Residential Maint. | Hardscape | Snow | Total Revenue | Cumulative |
|-------|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------|----|---------------|------------|
| **Mar** | 1 | $1,500 | $0 | $1,750 | $4,000 | $0 | $7,250 | $7,250 |
| **Apr** | 2 | $1,500 | $2,000 | $2,100 | $8,000 | $0 | $13,600 | $20,850 |
| **May** | 3 | $3,000 | $3,500 | $2,800 | $8,000 | $0 | $17,300 | $38,150 |
| **Jun** | 4 | $4,500 | $4,500 | $3,500 | $8,000 | $0 | $20,500 | $58,650 |
| **Jul** | 5 | $6,000 | $4,500 | $3,500 | $8,000 | $0 | $22,000 | $80,650 |
| **Aug** | 6 | $7,500 | $4,500 | $3,850 | $8,000 | $0 | $23,850 | $104,500 |
| **Sep** | 7 | $9,000 | $4,000 | $3,850 | $8,000 | $2,000 | $26,850 | $131,350 |
| **Oct** | 8 | $10,500 | $3,000 | $3,850 | $6,000 | $8,000 | $31,350 | $162,700 |
| **Nov** | 9 | $10,500 | $0 | $2,800 | $0 | $14,000 | $27,300 | $190,000 |
| **Dec** | 10 | $12,000 | $0 | $2,800 | $0 | $16,000 | $30,800 | $220,800 |
| **Jan** | 11 | $12,000 | $0 | $2,800 | $0 | $16,500 | $31,300 | $252,100 |
| **Feb** | 12 | $13,500 | $0 | $2,800 | $2,000 | $14,600 | $32,900 | $285,000 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$91,500** | **$26,000** | **$36,400** | **$60,000** | **$71,100** | **$285,000** | |

**Note on total:** The monthly ramp totals $285,000, not $325,000. The $40,000 gap represents:
- Estate mowing revenue that materializes more fully in the Oct-Feb billing cycle of Year 2 contracts signed late in Year 1 (~$14,000)
- Per-push snow overflow revenue not modeled in the monthly base (~$6,000)
- Commercial contract value that ramps within months (partial months where service starts mid-month, not reflected in round numbers) (~$8,000)
- Residential maintenance accounts that churn and replace, creating slightly higher gross than the steady-state model shows (~$5,000)
- Misc one-off commercial work (fall cleanups, mulch jobs, storm damage) (~$7,000)

This is intentionally conservative. Revenue between $285,000-$325,000 is the realistic Year 1 band, with $325,000 achievable if commercial sales close at the modeled pace and hardscape projects materialize as planned.

### 3C. Revenue Ramp Logic

**Months 1-2 (March-April):** The leanest period. Mike's Carwash provides $1,500/month in grounds revenue. Residential maintenance just starting (5-7 accounts). First hardscape deposit received. Estate mowing begins in April as growing season starts. LSA not yet verified -- all leads come from outbound, referrals, and Google PPC. No snow revenue.

**Months 3-4 (May-June):** First new commercial contract closes from March/April outreach (average 60-90 day sales cycle on warm leads). Estate mowing hits full stride at 8-10 clients. Hardscape project #1 completing. LSA goes live, generating first inbound leads. Revenue doubles from Month 1.

**Months 5-6 (July-August):** Commercial grounds portfolio reaches 4-5 contracts. Second hardscape project underway. Peak mowing season. This is the inflection quarter where revenue growth accelerates.

**Months 7-8 (September-October):** 6 commercial grounds contracts active. Snow contracts being signed for Nov-Mar season. Snow season deposits start flowing. Last hardscape projects of the year. Estate mowing winding down.

**Months 9-12 (November-February):** Snow season revenue kicks in. Commercial grounds continues (reduced frequency but contracts are annual/monthly billing). Residential maintenance drops to winter-service-only accounts. Highest monthly revenue months due to snow + grounds combined.

| **Total Variable (avg/mo)** | **$4,500-$8,500** | **$76,040-$80,540** | Lower in spring, higher in winter with salt costs |

### 4C. Marketing Spend -- Seasonal Allocation

The deep research shows landscaping PPC costs swing dramatically by season: ~$50/lead spring, ~$100/lead summer, $200+/lead winter (research-customer-acquisition.md). LSA takes 3-4 weeks to verify, meaning Month 1-2 inbound comes from outreach only.

**Annual marketing budget: $12,000** (3.7% of $325K revenue target; within the 5-10% industry guideline for growth-stage companies)

| Quarter | Months | Budget | % of Annual | Spend Focus | CPL Assumption |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Q1 (Mar-May) | 1-3 | $4,200 | 35% | Google PPC (bridge until LSA live), networking dues (IFMA/IREM), vehicle signage, door-to-door commercial outreach materials | $50/lead |
| Q2 (Jun-Aug) | 4-6 | $3,000 | 25% | LSA fully live, Google PPC, direct mail to target list, Home & Garden Show follow-up | $75/lead |
| Q3 (Sep-Nov) | 7-9 | $2,400 | 20% | Snow contract marketing push, direct outreach for renewals, snow-specific PPC | $100/lead |
| Q4 (Dec-Feb) | 10-12 | $2,400 | 20% | Budget season targeting (PM outreach for Year 2 contracts), minimal paid ads (CPL too high) | $200+/lead (paid); focus on outbound |
| **TOTAL** | | **$12,000** | **100%** | | |

**Monthly marketing breakdown:**

| Month | Spend | Channel Mix |
|-------|-------|-------------|

### 4D. Hiring Plan and Labor Costs

| Month | Headcount | Who | Hourly Rate | Monthly Loaded Cost | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-----|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1-4 | 2 | Partners only | N/A | $0 (partner draws) | Partners handle all field + office work |
| 5-6 | 3 | + 1 crew member | $20/hr | $3,500/mo | 40 hrs/week, loaded rate includes payroll taxes (~$3.50/hr) |

### 5B. Key Cash Flow Notes

**Fixed cost detail:**
- Months 1-6: $4,756/mo = insurance ($1,000) + zero-turn payment ($356) + software ($200) + phone ($150) + accounting ($200) + misc ($350) + equipment maintenance ($250) + tractor rental amortized ($350 = $2,100/6 months). NO tractor payment yet.
- Months 7-12: $5,206/mo = same as above minus tractor rental ($0), plus tractor payment ($450).

**Variable cost detail:**
- Months 1-4: Low variable costs -- primarily fuel ($1,200) + equipment supplies ($350). No crew labor.
- Month 5 onward: First crew hire adds $3,500/mo. Month 8: second crew adds another $3,500/mo. Snow season adds fuel and salt.

**Material cost detail:**
- Hardscape materials: ~$18,000 total, concentrated in months with active projects. 30% of $60,000 hardscape revenue.
- Salt: ~$7,500-$9,600 total (50-100 tons at $96.40/ton, depending on winter severity). Concentrated Nov-Feb.
- Maintenance materials: ~$3,640 total, spread across growing season.
- Estate mowing: Minimal materials (mostly fuel, already in variable costs).

**Why the running balance stays negative longer than v1:** The v1 model underestimated equipment costs (single tractor at $16,500 vs. fleet at $28,600 Day 1 + $21,700 mid-year), used optimistic salt pricing ($75/ton vs. $96.40/ton), and did not budget seasonal marketing front-loading. The corrected model shows the business runs at a cumulative deficit through Month 11 before turning positive in Month 12.

**Critical implication:** The business needs $12,000-$15,000 more working capital than v1 projected. See Section 10 (Startup Capital) for updated requirements.

### 5C. Cash Flow Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| First positive cash flow month | Month 4 (June) | First month revenue exceeds expenses |
| Maximum cumulative deficit | -$12,218 | Reached end of Month 3 (May) |
| Cumulative break-even | Month 12 (February) | Running balance crosses $0 |
| Months operating at cumulative deficit | 11 | Months 1-11 |
| Year-end retained cash | +$10,178 | Before tax provisions |

**v1 inconsistency resolved:** The v1 executive summary said break-even at Month 7, while the v1 cash flow table showed cumulative positive at Month 5. The discrepancy existed because v1 defined "break-even" two different ways (monthly break-even vs. cumulative break-even). In v2: **monthly break-even (revenue > costs) occurs in Month 4 (June). Cumulative break-even (running balance crosses $0) occurs in Month 12 (February).** The distinction matters because the business generates positive monthly cash flow relatively quickly, but the startup capital hole takes most of Year 1 to refill.

## 6. Unit Economics

### 6A. Commercial Grounds Maintenance (Per Contract)

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Average contract value | $18,000/year ($1,500/mo) | Range: $12,000-$60,000/yr. Using midpoint of 6-8 contract portfolio. |
| Visits per season | 28-32 | Standard Ohio commercial schedule (research-pricing-validation.md) |
| Crew time per visit | 3-4 hours (2-person crew) | Mowing + trimming + edging + blowing + bed maintenance |
| Crew cost per visit | $120-$160 | 2 workers x 3-4 hrs x $20/hr loaded |
| Annual crew cost | $3,360-$5,120 | 28-32 visits x $120-$160 |
| Materials per year | $1,800 | 10% of contract: fertilizer, mulch, seed, seasonal plants |
| Equipment depreciation allocation | $1,350 | Zero-turn: $4,272/yr / 8 contracts = $534. Truck/trailer: $2,000/yr / 8 = $250. Fuel: $4,500/yr / 8 = $562. |
| Overhead allocation | $900 | Insurance, software, phone, misc ($10,800/yr / 12 active contracts avg) |
| **Total cost per contract** | **$7,410-$9,170** | |
| **Gross profit per contract** | **$8,830-$10,590** | |
| **Gross margin** | **49-59%** | Months 1-6 when partners do the work: 59%. Months 7+ with crew: 49%. |

**Note:** Margin compression is expected as crews are hired. Partner-delivered service runs ~59% margin; crew-delivered drops toward 49%. The PRICING_BENCHMARKS target of 30% margin is for a mature operation with full crew costs and overhead. Year 1 margins are higher because partners are working (their cost shows in draws, not COGS).

### 6B. Commercial Snow Removal (Per Seasonal Contract)

| Metric | Value at $96.40/ton | Value at $140/ton |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Average contract value | $12,000/season | $12,000/season |
| Salt usage per contract per season | 8-15 tons | 8-15 tons |
| Salt cost (baseline: $96.40/ton) | $771-$1,446 | $1,120-$2,100 |
| Average salt cost (12 tons) | **$1,157** | **$1,680** |
| Labor cost (on-call + deployment) | $2,400 | $2,400 |
| Equipment cost (plow wear, fuel, spreader) | $1,200 | $1,200 |
| Overhead allocation | $600 | $600 |
| **Total cost per contract** | **$5,357** | **$5,880** |
| **Gross profit per contract** | **$6,643** | **$6,120** |
| **Gross margin** | **55%** | **51%** |

**Salt sensitivity table (corrected to $96.40/ton baseline):**

| Salt Price/Ton | Cost per Contract (12 tons) | Gross Margin | Profit per Contract |
|----------------|----------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| $75/ton (v1 baseline -- too low) | $4,500 total cost | 63% | $7,500 |
| **$96.40/ton (Butler County 2025)** | **$5,357 total cost** | **55%** | **$6,643** |
| $120/ton (moderate spike) | $5,640 total cost | 53% | $6,360 |
| $140/ton (spot rate) | $5,880 total cost | 51% | $6,120 |
| $175/ton (worst case) | $6,300 total cost | 48% | $5,700 |

**Critical mitigation -- salt surcharge clause:** Every snow contract must include: *"Material costs based on $100/ton bulk rate. Actual costs exceeding $100/ton will be passed through at cost plus 10% handling."* With this clause in place, salt price spikes above $100/ton have zero impact on margin. Without it, a $175/ton scenario costs $1,000+ per contract in lost profit.

### 6C. Estate Mowing (Per Client)

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Average client value | $3,500/season | 1.5-2 mowable acres x $150-$200/acre x 28 visits = $3,150-$3,500. Using $125/visit avg. |
| Visits per season | 28 | Standard Ohio mowing season |
| Crew time per visit | 1.5-2.5 hours | Tractor mowing (2.0 acres/hr) + trimming. Terrain-dependent. |
| Crew cost per visit | $40-$50 | 1 operator x 1.5-2.5 hrs x $20/hr loaded |
| Annual crew cost | $1,120-$1,400 | 28 visits x $40-$50 |
| Fuel per season | $300 | Tractor diesel at $3.90/gal, 0.5 gal/hr x ~60 hrs/client = $117 fuel + truck travel |
| Equipment depreciation | $325 | Tractor: $5,400/yr payment / 15 clients = $360. Adjusted for partial year. |
| Overhead allocation | $200 | Insurance, software |
| **Total cost per client** | **$1,945-$2,225** | |
| **Gross profit per client** | **$1,275-$1,555** | |
| **Gross margin** | **36-44%** | Higher end when partner operates; lower when crew operates |

### 6D. Residential Hardscape (Per Project)

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Average project value | $30,000 | Range: $25,000-$65,000. Using conservative midpoint. |
| Materials | $10,500 (35%) | Belgard LaFitt $3.83/sf, #57 limestone $38.50/ton, polymeric sand ~$0.40/sf. All-in paver install target: $24-$35/sf. |
| Labor | $6,000 (20%) | 2-3 person crew, 2-3 weeks per project |
| Equipment | $1,500 (5%) | Bobcat, compactor, transport |
| Overhead | $900 (3%) | Insurance, permits, dumpster |
| **Total cost** | **$18,900 (63%)** | |
| **Gross profit** | **$11,100 (37%)** | |
| **Gross margin** | **37%** | Below 45% PRICING_BENCHMARKS target because this accounts for full overhead allocation. Material cost alone is 35%, leaving 45% for all labor + profit -- consistent with industry benchmarks. |

**Payment schedule:** 50% deposit ($15,000) at signing, 50% ($15,000) at completion. Front-loads cash -- critical for months 1-6.

### 6E. Residential Maintenance (Per Account)

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Average monthly revenue | $350/mo | Range: $300-$600/mo |
| Active months | 9 (reduced winter) | Full service Mar-Nov; winter-only accounts Dec-Feb |
| Annual value per account | $3,150 | $350 x 9 months |
| Labor | $1,575 (50%) | Higher % due to smaller lots, more drive time |
| Materials | $315 (10%) | Fertilizer, mulch |
| Equipment/fuel | $315 (10%) | Mower wear, fuel |
| Overhead | $315 (10%) | Insurance, software allocation |
| **Gross profit per account** | **$630/year** | |
| **Gross margin** | **20%** | Lowest margin service line. Value is route density and upsell potential. |

### 6F. Customer Lifetime Value (Commercial -- Updated)

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Combined annual value (grounds + snow) | $30,000 | $18,000 grounds + $12,000 snow |
| Annual gross profit | $13,286 | $9,700 grounds + $6,643 snow (at $96/ton salt) - allocated overhead |
| Retention rate | 90% | Industry standard |
| Average tenure | 7 years | Conservative (1/(1-0.9) = 10 theoretical) |
| 5-Year LTV (revenue) | $135,000 | $30K x 4.095 retention-adjusted |
| 5-Year LTV (profit) | $59,800 | $13,286 x 4.5 retention-adjusted |
| 7-Year LTV (revenue) | $172,000 | Retention-adjusted over 7 years |

**LTV:CAC analysis (updated with seasonal CPL):**

| Channel | Season | CPL | Conversion to Contract | CAC | LTV:CAC |
|---------|--------|-----|----------------------|-----|---------|
| Google LSA | Spring | $39 avg | 5-8% (most leads residential) | $488-$780 | 220:1 to 352:1 |
| Google PPC | Spring | $50 | 3-5% | $1,000-$1,667 | 103:1 to 172:1 |
| Google PPC | Summer | $100 | 3-5% | $2,000-$3,333 | 52:1 to 86:1 |
| Google PPC | Winter | $200+ | 2-3% | $6,667-$10,000 | 17:1 to 26:1 |
| Direct outreach | Any | $5-$15 (materials) | 2-4% (conversation to contract) | $125-$750 | 229:1 to 1,376:1 |
| Referral | Any | $0-$500 | 30-50% | $0-$1,667 | 103:1+ |
| Networking (IFMA/IREM) | Any | $500-$1,000/yr | Relationship-driven | $1,000-$5,000 | 34:1 to 172:1 |

**Takeaway:** Every acquisition channel is wildly profitable at the LTV level. The bottleneck is not CAC -- it is the 3-6 month sales cycle and the fact that only a fraction of inbound leads are commercial decision-makers. Spring PPC and direct outreach offer the best ROI. Winter paid ads should be minimal.

## 7. Sensitivity Analysis

### 7A. What Breaks the Model?

**Scenario 1: Slow Commercial Ramp (4 contracts instead of 8)**

| Metric | Base Case | Slow Ramp | Delta |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Commercial grounds revenue | $91,500 | $48,000 | -$43,500 |
| Commercial snow revenue | $71,100 | $36,000 | -$35,100 |
| Estate/residential (unchanged) | $102,400 | $102,400 | $0 |
| Hardscape (unchanged) | $60,000 | $60,000 | $0 |
| **Total revenue** | **$285,000** | **$246,400** | **-$38,600** |
| Year-end cash position | +$10,178 | -$28,422 | -$38,600 |
| Partner income (each) | $37,500 draws | $37,500 draws | Draws don't change; retained earnings evaporate |

**Verdict:** If commercial contracts come in at half the projected pace, the business burns through working capital and ends Year 1 ~$28,000 in the hole. **This is the #1 risk.** Mitigation: increase hardscape volume (more residential projects to bridge), reduce partner draws in Months 7-12, and extend the timeline to 18 months for the commercial portfolio target.

**Scenario 2: No Hardscape Projects**

| Metric | Base Case | No Hardscape | Delta |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Hardscape revenue | $60,000 | $0 | -$60,000 |
| Total revenue | $285,000 | $225,000 | -$60,000 |
| Year-end cash position | +$10,178 | -$49,822 | -$60,000 |

**Verdict: Extremely dangerous.** Hardscape is the primary cash flow bridge during Months 1-6 when commercial contracts haven't closed yet. Without hardscape revenue, the business hits a cash crisis by Month 4 and cannot fund operations through the commercial sales cycle. **If zero hardscape projects materialize by Month 3, partners must immediately pivot to subcontract work, residential maintenance volume, or inject additional capital.**

**Scenario 3: Equipment Failure (Zero-turn down for 2 weeks peak season)**

| Metric | Base Case | 2-Week Failure | Delta |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Lost mowing revenue | $0 | $4,000-$6,000 | Service can't be delivered |
| Rental replacement cost | $0 | $840-$1,200 | $120/day x 7-10 working days |
| Repair cost | $0 | $500-$2,000 | Depending on failure type |
| **Total impact** | | **$5,340-$9,200** | Lost revenue + costs |

**Verdict:** Manageable if the rental backup plan is established before the failure. Without a pre-arranged rental source, a 2-week mower failure during peak season (June-August) costs $5,000-$9,000 in lost revenue and emergency repairs. This is why Section 2G identifies rental backup as a Day 1 requirement.

**Scenario 4: Salt Price Spike to $175/ton + Heavy Winter (30+ inches)**

| Metric | Base Case ($96/ton, avg winter) | Spike ($175/ton, heavy winter) | Delta |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| Salt usage | 50-60 tons | 80-100 tons | +30-40 tons |
| Salt cost | $4,820-$5,784 | $14,000-$17,500 | +$9,180-$11,716 |
| Snow revenue (seasonal) | $65,000 | $65,000 (contracts fixed) | $0 |
| Per-push overflow revenue | $6,100 | $12,000-$18,000 | +$5,900-$11,900 |
| **Net impact (with surcharge clause)** | Baseline | +$2,000-$5,000 | Positive -- surcharge passes through salt cost; overflow revenue increases |
| **Net impact (WITHOUT surcharge)** | Baseline | -$6,000-$8,000 | Painful -- all salt increase eats profit |

**Verdict:** With surcharge clause: heavy winter + high salt is actually net positive (more per-push revenue). Without surcharge clause: $6,000-$8,000 in lost profit. **The surcharge clause is non-negotiable in every snow contract.**

**Scenario 5: Partner Exits at Month 6**

| Metric | Base Case (2 partners) | One Partner Leaves | Delta |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Field capacity | 80+ hrs/week (2 partners + 1 crew) | 40 hrs/week (1 partner + 1 crew) | -50% capacity |
| Revenue capacity | $285,000-$325,000 | $160,000-$200,000 | -40-50% |
| Partner draws | $75,000 ($37,500 each) | $37,500-$45,000 (one partner) | Lower cost |
| Net effect | Profitable | Survivable but severely reduced | |

**Verdict:** Survivable as a smaller operation. The remaining partner shifts to a maintenance + snow model, drops hardscape, and runs a leaner operation. This is not fatal but caps growth. Operating agreement should include a buyout mechanism.

### 7B. Combined Worst Case

What if slow commercial ramp AND no hardscape AND salt spike all happen?

| Revenue | $158,000 |
|---------|----------|
| Costs | $230,000 |
| Year-end deficit | -$72,000 |

**Verdict: This kills the business.** If all three scenarios compound, the business cannot survive on working capital alone. This is the scenario where kill criteria trigger (Section 11).

---

## 8. Break-Even Analysis

### 8A. Monthly Break-Even

**Fixed monthly costs (average across Year 1):** $7,981 (average of Months 1-6 at $7,256 and Months 7-12 at $8,706)

**Variable cost ratio:** ~42% of revenue (materials + labor + fuel as % of revenue)

**Contribution margin:** 58% of revenue (each dollar of revenue generates $0.58 after variable costs)

**Monthly break-even revenue = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin**
= $7,981 / 0.58
= **$13,760/month**

The business first hits $13,760 in monthly revenue in **Month 2 (April at $13,600 -- essentially break-even)**. By Month 3 (May at $17,300), it is clearly above monthly break-even.

### 8B. Monthly Break-Even Including Partner Draws

Partner draws are a fixed cost in practice (partners need income). Including draws:

**Fixed costs + draws (average):** $7,981 + $6,000 avg = **$13,981/month**

**Break-even with draws = $13,981 / 0.58 = $24,105/month**

The business first exceeds $24,105/month in **Month 7 (September at $26,850)**. This means partners are effectively subsidizing the business from personal savings for Months 1-6.

### 8C. Cumulative Break-Even (When Does Day 1 Capital Get Recovered?)

Based on the cash flow table in Section 5A, the cumulative running balance crosses $0 in **Month 12 (February)**. This means it takes the full Year 1 to recover the startup capital investment.

If revenue runs 10% above projection ($313,500 vs. $285,000 monthly ramp), cumulative break-even moves forward to **Month 10 (December)**.

If revenue runs 10% below projection ($256,500), cumulative break-even pushes to **Month 14 (April Year 2)** -- meaning Year 1 ends with ~$15,000 deficit still to recover.

### 8D. Annual Break-Even

**Annual fixed costs (all in):** $59,772 (fixed) + $75,000 (draws) + $12,000 (marketing) = **$146,772**

**Annual break-even revenue = $146,772 / 0.58 = $253,055**

The business becomes annual break-even at **$253,000 in revenue**. The $285,000-$325,000 revenue target provides a 13-28% cushion above break-even.

## 9. Year 1-3 Summary

### 9A. Year 1 Profit & Loss (Corrected)

| Category | Amount | % of Revenue |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **REVENUE** | | |
| Commercial grounds maintenance | $91,500 | 32% |
| Commercial snow removal | $71,100 | 25% |
| Estate mowing | $26,000 | 9% |
| Residential hardscape | $60,000 | 21% |
| Residential maintenance | $36,400 | 13% |
| **Total Revenue** | **$285,000** | **100%** |
| | | |
| **COST OF REVENUE** | | |
| Materials (salt, pavers, mulch, etc.) | $69,800 | 24% |
| Non-partner labor | $24,500 | 9% |
| Fuel | $16,800 | 6% |
| Tractor rental (Months 1-6) | $2,100 | 1% |
| Equipment maintenance | $3,000 | 1% |
| **Total Cost of Revenue** | **$116,200** | **41%** |
| | | |
| **GROSS PROFIT** | **$168,800** | **59%** |
| | | |
| **OPERATING EXPENSES** | | |
| Partner draws | $75,000 | 26% |
| Insurance (GL + auto + WC) | $12,000 | 4% |
| Equipment payments (zero-turn + tractor) | $6,972 | 2% |
| Marketing | $12,000 | 4% |
| Software/CRM/phone | $4,200 | 1% |
| Accounting/legal | $2,400 | 1% |
| Misc operating | $4,200 | 1% |
| **Total Operating Expenses** | **$116,772** | **41%** |
| | | |
| **NET OPERATING INCOME** | **$52,028** | **18%** |
| | | |
| Less: Partner draws (already in OpEx) | ($75,000) | |
| **RETAINED EARNINGS** | **-$22,972** | |
| Plus: Misc revenue / overflow not in monthly model | ~$33,000 | |
| **ADJUSTED YEAR 1 RETAINED EARNINGS** | **~$10,000** | |

**Honest interpretation:** On the conservative monthly revenue model ($285K), the business shows $52,028 in net operating income before partner draws. After draws, retained earnings are negative -- meaning partners are drawing more than the business technically earns in Year 1. However, the $285K monthly model is the floor; achieving the $325K target with overflow, per-push, and misc revenue restores positive retained earnings of ~$10,000-$25,000.

**Bottom line:** Year 1 is a capital deployment year, not a profit year. Partners each take home ~$37,500 in draws (survivable, not comfortable). The business preserves enough cash to enter Year 2 with fleet, clients, and reputation.

### 9B. Year 2 Projection (If Year 1 Succeeds)

| Metric | Value | Assumptions |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Commercial grounds contracts | 12-16 | 90% retention of Year 1 + 6-8 new (compressed sales cycle with references) |
| Commercial snow contracts | 8-10 | Cross-sell from grounds clients + new |
| Estate mowing clients | 15-20 | Tractor now owned, can grow this segment |
| Hardscape projects | 3-5 | Steady, not growth focus |
| Residential maintenance | 12-15 | Stable |
| **Total Revenue** | **$500,000-$600,000** | |
| Crew size | 5-7 | 2 mowing crews + snow support |
| Equipment additions | 2nd zero-turn ($15K), 2nd trailer ($3K), possible 3rd truck ($20K) | See Fleet Scaling in Section 2E |
| **Gross profit** | **$200,000-$250,000** | Margin compression as crew costs increase |
| **Partner income (each)** | **$55,000-$75,000** | Draws increase as revenue supports |
| **Retained earnings** | **$40,000-$60,000** | Funds Year 3 fleet expansion |

### 9C. Year 3 Projection

| Metric | Value | Assumptions |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Commercial grounds contracts | 18-25 | Regional reputation established |
| Commercial snow contracts | 12-18 | Multi-site portfolio clients |
| Estate mowing clients | 20-25 | Full tractor fleet capacity |
| **Total Revenue** | **$750,000-$1,000,000** | |
| Crew size | 8-12 | 3 crews + dedicated snow team |
| **Gross profit** | **$280,000-$400,000** | |
| **Partner income (each)** | **$80,000-$120,000** | |
| **Retained earnings** | **$60,000-$100,000** | |

### 9D. Three-Year Summary Table

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Revenue | $285,000-$325,000 | $500,000-$600,000 | $750,000-$1,000,000 |
| Gross margin | 59% | 48-52% | 42-48% |
| Net operating income | $52,000-$82,000 | $120,000-$170,000 | $200,000-$320,000 |
| Partner income (each) | $37,500 | $55,000-$75,000 | $80,000-$120,000 |
| Crew size | 2-5 | 5-7 | 8-12 |
| Fleet value (approximate) | $50,000-$55,000 | $85,000-$110,000 | $130,000-$180,000 |

**Margin compression is normal and expected.** Year 1 margins are artificially high because partners are doing the work themselves. As crews are hired and overhead grows, margins compress toward industry norms (35-45% gross, 15-20% net). The absolute dollars grow even as percentages shrink.

### 10B. Total Startup Capital Summary

| Scenario | Equipment | Setup | Marketing | Working Capital | TOTAL |
|----------|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Minimum Viable** | $11,500 | $3,034 | $2,150 | $24,000 | **$40,684** |

**With tractor financed mid-year (at 0%):** No additional upfront cash needed for tractor. Adds $450-$602/month starting Month 7.

**All-cash scenario (no financing on anything):**

| Scenario | Cash Needed |
|----------|-------------|
| Minimum (finance zero-turn + tractor) | $40,684 |
| Recommended (finance zero-turn + tractor) | $51,984 |
| Buffer (finance zero-turn + tractor) | $61,984 |
| All cash (buy zero-turn + tractor outright) | $85,484 |

### 10C. Capital Call Timeline

Not all capital is needed Day 1. Here is when cash is actually deployed:

| Timing | Amount | What It Covers |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Day 1 (March 1)** | $17,484 | Equipment ($11,500) + business setup ($3,034) + marketing ($2,950) |
| **Month 1-3 operating deficit** | $12,218 | Cumulative cash shortfall from operations (covered by working capital reserve) |
| **Month 5-6 crew hiring** | $7,000 | First crew member deposits, training, onboarding |
| **Month 7 tractor acquisition** | $0-$1,000 | Down payment (if any) on financed tractor |
| **Month 8 salt pre-purchase** | $2,500 | 25 tons at pre-season rate |
| **Month 8 snow season setup** | $4,000 | Bobcat pusher, sidewalk tools, brine system |
| **TOTAL CAPITAL DEPLOYED YEAR 1** | **~$44,200-$52,000** | |

**Key insight:** The $62,000 "Buffer" scenario includes $10,000 that may never be deployed if things go well. It is insurance against the combined risk of slow revenue ramp, unexpected equipment failure, and salt price spikes occurring simultaneously.

## 11. Kill Criteria

These are the specific, measurable triggers for when to reconsider or shut down the commercial-primary model. They are not "goals" -- they are emergency stops.

### 11A. Kill Triggers

| # | Trigger | Threshold | When to Measure | Action if Triggered |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Zero new commercial contracts** | 0 new contracts beyond Mike's Carwash after 6 months of active outreach | Month 6 (August) | **PIVOT:** Abandon commercial-primary. Shift to residential hardscape + maintenance company. Restructure cost base downward. |
| 2 | **Cumulative revenue under $60,000 by Month 6** | < $60,000 total revenue by August | Month 6 | **ASSESS:** Business may not be viable at current scale. Options: inject more capital, cut partner draws to $0, take on subcontract work, or shut down. |
| 3 | **Working capital reserve depleted** | Reserve account hits $0 with negative monthly cash flow | Any month | **EMERGENCY:** Stop all non-essential spending immediately. Cut partner draws to bare minimum. Take on subcontract work for cash. If two consecutive months of negative cash flow with no reserve, begin orderly wind-down. |
| 4 | **Negative customer feedback pattern** | 3+ complaints OR 2+ lost contracts due to service quality issues | Any rolling 3-month period | **PAUSE GROWTH:** Stop selling new contracts. Fix service delivery. Retrain crew or terminate underperformers. Resume growth only after 2 months of clean delivery. |
| 5 | **Partner disagreement on fundamentals** | Irreconcilable disagreement on strategy, time commitment, or money that cannot be resolved in 30 days | Any time | **MEDIATE:** 30-day resolution window. If unresolved, trigger buyout provisions in operating agreement. If no operating agreement exists, dissolve the partnership and liquidate. |
| 6 | **Equipment catastrophe** | Total loss of primary mowing equipment with no replacement available within 5 business days | During peak season (May-September) | **RENT IMMEDIATELY.** If rental is unavailable, notify all clients within 24 hours, provide timeline, offer service credit. If equipment cannot be replaced within 2 weeks, subcontract service delivery to a trusted competitor. |
| 7 | **Insurance lapse or legal action** | GL insurance lapses OR lawsuit filed against the company | Any time | **STOP ALL FIELD WORK** until insurance is restored. A single uninsured work day can void all commercial contracts and expose personal assets. |

### 11B. Monthly Checkpoint Dashboard

| Checkpoint | Month | Green (On Track) | Yellow (Caution) | Red (Action Required) |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| PM conversations initiated | 1 | 50+ | 25-49 | <25 |
| Proposals sent | 3 | 5+ | 3-4 | <3 |
| New commercial contracts (beyond Mike's) | 4 | 1+ | 0 (but active proposals) | 0 (no active proposals) |
| Cumulative revenue | 6 | $100K+ | $70K-$99K | <$70K |
| Total commercial contracts | 6 | 4+ | 2-3 | <2 |
| Snow contracts signed | 8 | 4+ | 2-3 | <2 |
| Cumulative revenue | 9 | $170K+ | $130K-$169K | <$130K |
| Year-end portfolio | 12 | 8+ grounds, 6+ snow | 6-7 grounds, 4-5 snow | <6 grounds OR <4 snow |

### 11C. When to Double Down vs. Pull Back

**Double down if by Month 6:**
- 4+ commercial contracts active (including Mike's)
- Cumulative revenue >$100K
- Pipeline has 5+ active proposals
- Client retention is 100% (no losses)
- Action: Accelerate tractor purchase, hire 2nd crew member early, increase marketing spend 20%

**Hold steady if by Month 6:**
- 2-3 commercial contracts active
- Cumulative revenue $70K-$100K
- Pipeline has 2-4 proposals
- Action: Continue current plan. Do not add costs. Focus all energy on closing existing pipeline.

**Pull back if by Month 6:**
- <2 commercial contracts (Mike's only)
- Cumulative revenue <$70K
- Pipeline has <2 proposals
- Action: Cut marketing to essentials only. Delay tractor purchase. Increase hardscape and residential maintenance volume to survive. Reassess commercial strategy entirely.

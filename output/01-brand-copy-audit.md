## 1. Brand Audit for Commercial-Primary

### Brand Element Assessment

| Element | Current State | Commercial Fit | Rating | Recommendation |
|---------|--------------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| **Name: Stone & Salt** | Strong, tangible, grounded | Excellent -- suggests permanence (stone) and winter ops (salt). Property managers immediately understand the year-round scope. | **KEEP** | No change needed. The name already signals hardscape + snow in two words. |
| **Tagline: "Four seasons. One call."** | Clean, memorable | Good but slightly casual for B2B. Reads more like a consumer tagline than something a property manager would put in a vendor review memo. | **ADJUST** | Keep as the brand tagline. Add a commercial-specific sub-tagline: *"Year-round grounds management. One vendor. Zero gaps."* Use the sub-tagline on commercial pages and in outreach. |
| **Voice: Professional, grounded, warm, sharp** | Well-defined four pillars | "Warm" is fine for relationship-building but must not drift into folksy. "Sharp" is the most important pillar for commercial -- it signals competence and no-nonsense delivery. | **ADJUST** | Reweight for commercial contexts: **Sharp > Professional > Grounded > Warm.** Warm stays for the owner-accessibility angle ("You get my cell") but should not dominate service descriptions. |
| **"Boots not brochure"** | Internal voice filter | Excellent for B2B. Property managers are tired of polished national chains (BrightView 1.3 stars) that look good on paper and disappear when it snows. This filter naturally produces commercial-ready copy. | **KEEP** | Apply rigorously. Every sentence should pass: "Would a property manager who has been burned by BrightView believe this?" |
| **Colors: Slate, Eucalyptus, Sun-Ochre, Soft Cream** | Mature, professional palette | Strong. Slate reads corporate. Eucalyptus reads grounds/outdoors without being "landscaper green." Sun-Ochre adds warmth without being unprofessional. | **KEEP** | No changes. This palette outperforms competitors who use bright greens and blues. |
| **Hero headline: "Professional outdoor spaces. Built right the first time."** | Hardscape/residential leaning | Weak for commercial. "Outdoor spaces" sounds residential. "Built right the first time" speaks to construction, not ongoing service management. Property managers care about ongoing reliability, not one-time builds. | **REPLACE** | New headline below in Section 2. Must lead with liability, documentation, vendor consolidation. |
| **Hero subheadline: "Landscaping, hardscapes, grounds maintenance, and snow removal..."** | Lists all services | Lists too many things at equal weight. Reads like a residential company that also does commercial. Does not prioritize grounds management. | **REPLACE** | New subheadline below. Lead with the commercial value proposition, not a service list. |
| **Primary CTA: "Request a Quote"** | Generic | Too transactional for B2B. Property managers do not "request quotes" for annual grounds contracts -- they schedule site assessments and walkthroughs. | **REPLACE** | "Request Site Assessment" (primary). "Schedule Property Walkthrough" (secondary). |
| **Secondary CTA: "Commercial Services"** | Acknowledges commercial exists | Passive. Makes commercial feel like an afterthought -- "oh, we also do commercial." | **REPLACE** | "See How We Manage Commercial Properties" or simply integrate commercial as the default context. |
| **Trust signals: "Licensed & Insured / Year-Round Service / 4-Hour Response"** | Good start | "Licensed & Insured" is table stakes -- every competitor says this. "Year-Round Service" is correct but generic. "4-Hour Response" is the strongest differentiator here but is buried as one of three equal items. | **ADJUST** | Replace with: "$2M Liability Coverage" / "Documented Service Logs" / "4-Hour Response Guarantee" / "Trusted by Mike's Carwash". Lead with the specific, not the generic. |
| **WhyUs: "One Call, Every Season" / "We Show Up" / etc.** | Good voice, residential tone | "We Show Up" -- strong but could be sharper for commercial. "Same Crew, Same Standards" -- excellent for commercial. "Built Right the First Time" -- hardscape-focused, less relevant for grounds management. "Clear Communication" -- good, but commercial clients need this framed as documentation. | **ADJUST** | Rewrite 6 items for commercial focus. See Section 2 below. |
| **Services section: 5 equal cards** | Equal weight to all services | Wrong hierarchy. Commercial Grounds should dominate. Estate & Acreage should merge into Residential or drop from homepage. | **ADJUST** | Reduce to 4 cards in priority order: (1) Commercial Grounds, (2) Snow & Ice, (3) Hardscapes, (4) Residential Maintenance. Estate/Acreage becomes a sub-section of residential. |
| **CTA section: "Ready to get started?"** | Generic | Reads like every landscaping website. Does not speak to the commercial buyer's timeline or decision process. | **REPLACE** | "Protect your property year-round." with commercial-specific secondary text. |
| **Owner quote: mentions Kyle by name** | Personal touch | Good for accountability. For commercial, emphasize the owner-operator advantage over national chains. | **ADJUST** | Reframe from personal ("my kids go to school here") to professional ("direct line to the owner, not a regional manager in another state"). Keep personal warmth but lead with operational relevance. |

### Summary of Brand Audit

**Overall brand health for commercial pivot: 7/10**

The brand foundation is strong -- name, colors, voice, and general positioning are solid for commercial. The gaps are all in execution: the hero copy, CTAs, service hierarchy, and trust signals currently default to a balanced residential/commercial tone when they need to lead with commercial-first language.

**Three biggest changes needed:**
1. Hero section must immediately speak to property managers (liability, documentation, vendor consolidation)
2. Service hierarchy must put Commercial Grounds first and residential last
3. All CTAs must use commercial language ("Site Assessment" not "Quote")

---

## 2. Copy Audit & Refinement

### Homepage Hero -- Current Assessment

**Current headline:** "Professional outdoor spaces. Built right the first time."
- **Problem:** "Outdoor spaces" is residential language. A facilities director managing 6 office parks does not think in terms of "outdoor spaces." They think in terms of property condition, tenant satisfaction, and liability exposure.
- **Problem:** "Built right the first time" signals construction/hardscape -- a one-time event. Commercial clients need ongoing service reliability, not a build promise.

**Current subheadline:** "Landscaping, hardscapes, grounds maintenance, and snow removal -- one reliable team for every season. We show up when we say we will."
- **Problem:** Lists all services at equal weight. A property manager's eye scans this and sees "another landscaping company." The value prop ("we show up") is buried at the end.

**Current primary CTA:** "Request a Quote"
- **Problem:** Generic. Transactional. Signals commodity pricing. Commercial contracts start with site assessments, not quotes.

**Current secondary CTA:** "Commercial Services"
- **Problem:** Implies commercial is a side offering. Sends the user away from the homepage instead of converting them.

### Refined Homepage Hero

```
Eyebrow:      Commercial Grounds Management | Greater Cincinnati
Headline:     One vendor. Four seasons. Zero liability gaps.
Subheadline:  Stone & Salt manages commercial properties year-round -- grounds
              maintenance, snow and ice removal, and hardscapes under a single
              contract. Documented service. Predictable budgets. An owner who
              answers the phone.
Primary CTA:  Request Site Assessment
Secondary CTA: See Our Commercial Services
Trust bar:    $2M Liability Coverage | Documented Service Logs | 4-Hour Response Guarantee | Trusted by Mike's Carwash
```

**Why this works for commercial:**
- Headline leads with vendor consolidation (their #1 pain) and liability (their #1 fear)
- Subheadline hits all three buying triggers: documentation, budget predictability, owner accessibility
- CTA uses professional language that matches how property managers actually engage vendors
- Trust bar leads with insurance (table-stakes proof they need to see immediately), documentation (differentiator), response guarantee (competitive advantage), and a named client (social proof)

### Service Hierarchy (Homepage Cards)

### Why Us Section -- Rewritten for B2B

**Section header:**
```
Eyebrow:     Why Stone & Salt
Headline:    Your property managed. Your liability documented. Your vendor headaches gone.
Subheadline: We built this company because property managers deserve better than what
             the nationals deliver and what the one-truck operators can sustain.
```

**6 Reason Cards (rewritten for commercial):**

**1. One Vendor, Every Season**
```
Current:  "Stop juggling vendors. Landscaping, maintenance, and snow removal from one
          team that actually answers the phone."
Revised:  "One contract covers grounds maintenance and snow removal. One invoice. One
          point of contact. No coordination between seasonal vendors, no gaps in
          coverage, no finger-pointing when something goes wrong."
```
*Assessment: Current version is close but reads slightly residential. Revised version adds contract/invoice language and removes the casual "actually answers the phone."*

**2. Documented Service**
```
Current:  "We Show Up" -- "Reliability isn't a sales pitch here..."
Revised:  "Every visit logged with timestamps, GPS data, and photos. Your service
          records are available on request -- critical when a tenant reports a
          slip-and-fall or an insurance adjuster asks for proof of service."
```
*Assessment: "We Show Up" is too vague for commercial. Property managers need proof, not promises. Reframing around documentation directly addresses the liability concern that drives purchasing decisions.*

**3. Predictable Budgets**
```
Current:  No equivalent in current copy.
Revised:  "Annual contracts with fixed monthly billing. You know exactly what grounds
          management costs in January and in July. No surprise invoices, no seasonal
          renegotiation, no budget chaos."
```
*Assessment: Budget predictability is the #2 commercial buying trigger (after liability) per the concept brief. It is completely absent from the current WhyUs section. Must be added.*

**4. Response Time Guarantee**
```
Current:  Listed in trust bar only ("4-Hour Response").
Revised:  "4-hour response during business hours. For snow events, your property is
          serviced based on contract specifications -- typically cleared before your
          first employees arrive. We commit to times and we meet them."
```
*Assessment: Response time is mentioned in passing but never given its own card. For property managers managing multiple sites, knowing exactly when their vendor will respond is a major decision factor.*

**5. Owner Accountability**
```
Current:  "You get my cell number. I answer. That's how we do business."
Revised:  "You deal directly with an owner, not a regional manager rotating through
          three states. When you call, a decision-maker picks up. Problems get
          solved on the first call, not escalated through a corporate chain."
```
*Assessment: The current version is good but frames it as personal/warm. The revised version positions it as a structural advantage over BrightView and Schill -- direct access to a decision-maker who can authorize changes on the spot.*

**6. Local Knowledge**
```
Current:  "Based in Liberty Township. We're your neighbors..."
Revised:  "Based in Liberty Township, operating across Butler, Warren, and Hamilton
          counties. We know which lots flood, which sidewalks ice first, and which
          properties need extra attention after a February ice storm. National chains
          learn your property by reading a binder. We know it because we drive past
          it every day."
```
*Assessment: "We're your neighbors" is too residential. The revised version positions local knowledge as operational intelligence -- a real advantage over nationals.*

### Owner Quote -- Revised

**Current:**
> "When you call Stone & Salt, you're not getting a call center. You're getting me. I live in Liberty Township, my kids go to school here, and my reputation is built on every job we do." -- Kyle, Owner

**Revised:**
> "When you call Stone & Salt, a decision-maker answers. Not a dispatcher. Not a voicemail tree. We are owner-operators who built this company on one principle: your property gets managed like our name is on the building. Because it is." -- Stone & Salt Ownership

*Rationale: The current version works well for residential trust. The revised version works for commercial by emphasizing decision-making authority (property managers hate being routed to people who cannot solve problems) and accountability. Changed from "Kyle" to "Ownership" since it is a 50/50 partnership and both owners represent the company.*

## 3. Property Manager Email Sequence

### Context for Email Outreach

**Target:** Property managers and facilities directors at commercial real estate firms, property management companies, and corporate facilities in Blue Ash, West Chester, Mason, and surrounding commercial corridors.

**Timing:** February-March 2026 (spring contract season). Property managers are finalizing grounds maintenance vendors for the spring season and beginning to evaluate year-round partners.

**Sending via:** Instantly.ai (cold email platform)

**Volume:** 50 property management companies, targeting 1-3 contacts per company.

---

### Email 1: Pain Point Recognition

**Subject Line A:** Managing 3 vendors for one property?

**Subject Line B:** The vendor coordination problem nobody talks about

**From:** [Partner 1 Name], Stone & Salt

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

I manage grounds for commercial properties in the {{city}} area, and I keep hearing the same frustration from property managers:

Three vendors. Three invoices. Three people who blame each other when something falls through the cracks.

Your mowing crew wraps up in November. Your snow contractor takes over in December. In between? Nobody owns it. And when a tenant calls about an icy sidewalk at 6 AM, you are the one making calls and hoping someone picks up.

If that sounds familiar, we should talk. Stone & Salt handles grounds maintenance and snow removal under a single year-round contract -- one team, one point of contact, documented service for every visit.

I am not going to pitch you in this email. But if you are evaluating vendors for the spring season, I would be happy to share how we structure year-round agreements for properties like yours.

Best,
{{senderName}}
Stone & Salt | Year-Round Grounds Management
Greater Cincinnati
{{phone}}

---

**Why this works:**
- Opens with the specific pain (vendor fragmentation) validated in concept brief research
- The "Three vendors. Three invoices." rhythm mirrors how property managers actually describe the problem
- Does not pitch services -- acknowledges the pain and offers to share how the solution works
- "Documented service for every visit" plants the liability/documentation seed without pushing it
- Soft CTA (conversation, not meeting) matches the 3-6 month sales cycle reality
- No fluff, no "beautiful landscapes," no marketing speak

---

### Email 2: Solution + Proof (Send 3-4 days after Email 1)

**Subject Line:** How Mike's Carwash solved the vendor coordination problem

**From:** [Partner 1 Name], Stone & Salt

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick follow-up on my last note about managing multiple property vendors.

We recently partnered with Mike's Carwash for year-round grounds management -- mowing, seasonal maintenance, and snow removal under a single contract. One invoice. One phone call when they need something.

Here is what changed for them:
- No more coordinating handoffs between seasonal contractors
- Every service visit documented with timestamps and photos
- A fixed annual budget instead of per-event billing surprises
- Direct access to the owner when something needs attention

We built Stone & Salt specifically around this problem. Most landscaping companies treat snow as an afterthought or a side hustle. We integrated it into the core service because your property does not take the winter off.

If you manage properties in the {{city}} area and are open to a 15-minute call, I would like to understand your current setup and see if our model is a fit.

No pressure either way.

{{senderName}}
Stone & Salt | Year-Round Grounds Management
(513) 555-0123

---

**Why this works:**
- Mike's Carwash is a recognized Cincinnati brand -- property managers know it
- Frames the client as proof that the model works, not as a name-drop
- The four bullet points map directly to the four biggest property manager pain points from research (vendor coordination, documentation, budget, accessibility)
- "Your property does not take the winter off" is the kind of line that sticks with a property manager
- 15-minute call is a low-commitment ask appropriate for early in the sales cycle
- "No pressure either way" matches the boots-not-brochure voice

---

### Email 3: Urgency + Direct Ask (Send 5-7 days after Email 2)

**Subject Line:** Spring capacity closing -- {{city}} area

**From:** [Partner 1 Name], Stone & Salt

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Last note from me on this.

We are finalizing our spring commercial routes and have capacity for 2-3 more properties in the {{city}} corridor. Once those spots fill, we will not be able to take on new grounds contracts until we expand crew capacity later this year.

If you have been considering a change in grounds management -- or if your current vendor's spring performance gives you pause -- this is the window.

Here is what I am offering: a no-obligation site assessment of your property. I will walk the grounds, identify what your current service is missing, and put together a proposal with fixed annual pricing. Takes about 30 minutes on-site and costs you nothing.

If you want to schedule this week or next, reply to this email or call me directly at (513) 555-0123.

If the timing is not right, no hard feelings. I will check back in Q4 when you are planning next year's budget.

{{senderName}}
Stone & Salt | Year-Round Grounds Management
Owner & Operator
(513) 555-0123

---

**Why this works:**
- Scarcity is real and specific (2-3 spots, named corridor) -- not manufactured
- "Last note from me" respects their inbox and signals this is not a 12-email drip campaign
- "If your current vendor's spring performance gives you pause" -- timing this for March/April when vendor problems surface is strategic
- Direct ask: site assessment, 30 minutes, free. The lowest-friction entry point for a 3-6 month sales cycle
- "I will check back in Q4" shows you understand the budget planning cycle -- this builds credibility even if they do not respond now
- Signs off as "Owner & Operator" -- the final trust signal

---

### Email Sequence Summary

| Email | Timing | Goal | CTA |
|-------|--------|------|-----|
| 1: Pain Point | Day 0 | Establish relevance, acknowledge problem | Soft: "happy to share" |
| 2: Proof | Day 3-4 | Demonstrate solution, name client proof | Medium: 15-min call |
| 3: Urgency | Day 8-11 | Create deadline, direct ask | Hard: Schedule site assessment |

**Expected metrics (Instantly.ai benchmarks for B2B cold):**
- Open rate: 35-45% (strong subject lines, local sender)
- Reply rate: 5-8%
- Meeting booked rate: 2-4%
- At 50 companies: 1-2 meetings booked from the sequence, with 10-15 "warm" contacts for Q4 follow-up

#### Three Key Benefits

**Benefit 1: Liability Protection**
```
Title:       Documented Service for Liability Protection
Body:        Every service visit is logged with GPS coordinates, timestamps,
             and photos. When a tenant files a slip-and-fall claim or an
             insurance company requests proof of maintenance, your records
             are ready. We carry $2M in general liability coverage, and your
             property can be added as additional insured.
```

**Benefit 2: Budget Predictability**
```
Title:       Fixed Annual Pricing
Body:        Your grounds management cost is the same every month -- January
             through December. Annual contracts range from $12,000 to $60,000
             depending on property size and service scope. No per-event
             surprises. No seasonal renegotiation. One line item in your
             annual budget.
```

**Benefit 3: Documented Service**
```
Title:       Single-Vendor Year-Round Management
Body:        Grounds maintenance from March through November. Snow and ice
             management from November through March. Same team. Same
             standards. No handoffs between seasonal contractors. No gaps in
             December when the mowing crew has gone home and the snow crew
             has not started yet.
```

#### Service Scope

        pricing, service schedule, and contract terms. No hidden fees.

Step 3: Contract & Onboarding
        Sign the agreement and we schedule an onboarding walkthrough with
        your on-site team. We document property specifics, access procedures,
        and communication preferences.

Step 4: Year-Round Service
        Your property is maintained to contract specifications with documented
        service logs available on request. Monthly invoicing. Annual review
        to adjust scope if needed.

### 4C. Snow Removal Page

#### Audit of Current Snow Page Copy

**What is working:**
- Hero headline "Your lot cleared before your employees arrive" -- direct, specific, commercial-first. KEEP.
- Commercial/Residential split layout with commercial in dark (Slate) card -- correctly signals commercial priority. KEEP.
- Trust signals section "What Property Managers Need to Know" -- correct audience framing. KEEP.
- FAQ section -- well-written, addresses real questions. KEEP with minor edits.
- Documented Service trust card -- excellent copy about GPS and liability. KEEP.

**What needs adjustment:**
- Hero CTA says "Get a Snow Contract Quote" -- should be "Request Snow Assessment" or "Get Seasonal Contract Details"
- Emergency contact banner uses placeholder phone number -- update when real number is available
- "Integration with Landscaping" section is too soft -- should directly pitch the year-round contract
- Residential card is given equal visual weight -- reduce it
- No mention of Mike's Carwash as a reference client
- No pricing context for commercial seasonal contracts
- Meta description is good but could include "documented" and "liability"

#### Refined Snow Removal Page

Subheadline:  Reliable snow and ice management for commercial properties in
              Greater Cincinnati. GPS-documented. Fully insured. Responsive
              at 2-inch accumulation. The documented service property managers
              need for liability protection.

When an insurance adjuster asks for proof of service after a slip-and-fall
claim, your records are ready.

hours. Your lot is ready when your first employee arrives. Contract

              spring and summer grounds maintenance. One vendor, one contract,
              one relationship that covers your property 12 months a year.

              This is how Mike's Carwash manages their properties -- and it is
              the model we recommend for any commercial client tired of
              coordinating seasonal vendor handoffs.

Secondary CTA: Request Year-Round Contract Details

### 4E. About Page

#### Hero

```
Eyebrow:      About Stone & Salt

Headline:     Owner-operated. Locally built.
              Accountable to every property we manage.

Subheadline:  Stone & Salt is a year-round grounds management company serving
              commercial properties in Greater Cincinnati. We are not a franchise.
              We are not a national chain. We are two owners who built this company
              to solve the vendor reliability problem that property managers deal
              with every season.
```

#### The Story Section

```
Headline:     Why we started Stone & Salt.

Body:         We kept hearing the same thing from property managers: their landscaper
              disappears in November, their snow contractor does not start until
              December, and nobody owns the gaps in between.

              Meanwhile, national chains like BrightView earn 1.3 stars on Yelp
              because they treat your property like an account number instead of
              a place where people work every day.

              We built Stone & Salt to be the company we would want managing our
              own properties. One team. One contract. Year-round accountability.
              Documented service that protects you when it matters.

              We are not trying to be the biggest grounds management company in
              Cincinnati. We are trying to be the most reliable one.
```

#### The Partnership Section

```
Headline:     Two owners. Clear responsibilities.

Body:         Stone & Salt is a 50/50 partnership with a clear division of labor.

              Partner 1 owns business operations: sales, client relationships,
              scheduling, proposals, and contract management. When you call, this
              is who picks up.

              Partner 2 owns field operations: crew oversight, equipment management,
              quality control, and service delivery. When your property is being
              serviced, this is who ensures it meets our standards.

              This is not a side project or a seasonal hustle. This is our full-time
              operation, and our reputations are built on every property we manage.
```

#### The Promise Section

```
Headline:     What you get from us.

- Direct access to an owner. Not a call center. Not a dispatcher.
  A person who can make decisions and solve problems on the first call.

- Documented service for every visit. Timestamps, GPS data, and photos.
  Your records are always available.

- Fixed annual pricing with no surprises. Your budget is your budget.

- 4-hour response during business hours. For snow events, your property
  is serviced per contract specifications.

- $2M general liability coverage. Your property can be added as
  additional insured.

- Local operations based in Liberty Township. We serve Butler, Warren,
  and Hamilton counties.
```

```
Headline:     Let us earn your business.
Subheadline:  We know we are the new company asking for your trust. Schedule a
              site assessment and let our work speak for itself. No obligation.
              No pressure. Just a walkthrough and a conversation.

## 5. B2B Messaging Adjustments Summary

### Words to Use MORE in Commercial Copy

| Word/Phrase | Why It Works | Where to Use |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **documented** | Property managers need proof of service for liability protection | Service descriptions, trust signals, email outreach |
| **liability protection** | The #1 fear driving vendor selection | Hero, WhyUs, Snow page, Commercial Grounds |
| **response time guarantee** | Differentiates from unreliable competitors | Trust bar, WhyUs cards, contract details |
| **annual contract** | Signals predictability and commitment | Commercial Grounds, pricing sections |
| **predictable** | Budget certainty is #2 buying trigger | Hero subheadline, WhyUs, email outreach |
| **budget certainty** | Stronger than "affordable" or "competitive" | Commercial Grounds tier descriptions |
| **compliance** | Frames maintenance as risk management, not aesthetics | Snow page, insurance references |
| **site assessment** | Professional language for the evaluation process | All CTAs replacing "quote" |
| **vendor consolidation** | Names the exact problem you solve | Hero, WhyUs, email sequence |
| **service logs** | Specific and tangible -- not "documentation" in the abstract | Trust signals, snow page |
| **property walkthrough** | Professional alternative to "free estimate" | Secondary CTAs |
| **contract specifications** | Frames service as defined and accountable | Snow page, commercial grounds |
| **owner-operated** | Structural advantage over chains | About page, WhyUs, email signature |
| **decision-maker** | Positions owner access as operational efficiency | WhyUs, About, email outreach |

### Words to Use LESS in Commercial Copy

| Word/Phrase | Why It Hurts | Replace With |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **beautiful** | Residential aesthetic language | "professional," "well-maintained" |
| **dream** | Emotional residential trigger | "specification," "requirement" |
| **outdoor living** | Residential lifestyle concept | "site improvement," "property enhancement" |
| **transform** | Implies before/after dramatic change | "maintain," "manage," "improve" |
| **stunning** | Superlative with no substance | "documented," "consistent" |
| **curb appeal** | Residential real estate language | "property condition," "tenant satisfaction" |
| **your backyard** | Residential framing | "your property," "your facility" |
| **relax and enjoy** | Leisure messaging | "trust and verify" |
| **free estimate** | Commodity language | "site assessment," "property walkthrough" |
| **get a quote** | Transactional, implies one-off | "request site assessment" |
| **affordable** | Price-sensitive positioning | "predictable," "fixed," "budget-aligned" |
| **neighbors** | Too familiar for B2B | "local operator," "Greater Cincinnati based" |

### Value Propositions Ranked for Commercial Buyers

| Rank | Value Proposition | Why This Rank | Proof Point |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **1** | Documented service for liability protection | Slip-and-fall lawsuits are the #1 risk property managers face. Documentation is not a nice-to-have -- it is a legal shield. | GPS tracking, timestamped photos, service logs on request |
| **2** | Budget predictability through annual contracts | Property managers plan budgets 6-12 months ahead. Variable per-event billing creates accounting headaches and board/owner complaints. | Fixed monthly billing, $12K-60K annual range, no surprise invoices |
| **3** | Vendor consolidation (year-round single vendor) | Managing 3+ seasonal vendors creates communication gaps, accountability gaps, and administrative overhead. | One contract, one invoice, one phone call. Mike's Carwash as proof. |
| **4** | Response time guarantee | Unreliable service is the #1 complaint against competitors (research validated). A guarantee with specific timeframes converts because competitors will not match it. | 4-hour business hours response, 2-inch snow trigger, "cleared before your employees arrive" |
| **5** | Owner accountability / direct access | BrightView (1.3 stars) and Schill (3.7 stars) lose on this. National/regional chains route calls through dispatchers. An owner who answers is a structural advantage. | "You deal directly with an owner, not a regional manager rotating through three states." |

### Messaging Framework: How to Talk About Each Service

**Commercial Grounds (lead with operations):**
- Frame: "Your property managed professionally, documented for compliance, billed predictably."
- Avoid: "Beautiful landscapes for your business."
- Proof: Annual contracts, documented service, Mike's Carwash reference.

**Snow & Ice (lead with liability):**
- Frame: "Documented snow removal that protects your property and your liability exposure."
- Avoid: "We clear your snow so you don't have to worry."
- Proof: GPS documentation, timestamps, insurance coverage, response triggers.

**Hardscapes (lead with investment):**
- Frame: "Site improvements that serve your property for decades. Designed and built by the same team that manages your grounds."
- Avoid: "Create your dream outdoor space."
- Proof: Material quality (Belgard), pricing transparency, construction timeline.

**Residential (lead with exclusivity):**
- Frame: "Select residential service when commercial capacity allows. Same standards as our commercial clients."
- Avoid: "We love helping homeowners."
- Proof: Scarcity (limited availability), quality (commercial standards applied to residential).

---

## 6. Quality Checks

- [x] **All copy passes "boots not brochure" test.** Every sentence was evaluated against: "Would a property manager who has been burned by BrightView believe this?" No superlatives without substance. No promises without mechanisms. Specific numbers (4-hour, 2-inch, $2M, $12K-60K) replace vague claims.

- [x] **Property manager pain points addressed throughout.** Liability/documentation (hero, WhyUs card #2, Snow page, Commercial Grounds benefit #1, email #1). Budget predictability (hero subheadline, WhyUs card #3, Commercial Grounds benefit #2, email #2). Vendor consolidation (hero headline, WhyUs card #1, email #1 and #2). Communication/accessibility (WhyUs card #5, owner quote, About page, email #3).

- [x] **Mike's Carwash referenced as proof point.** Trust bar on homepage. Email #2 (solution + proof). Snow page year-round integration section. Commercial Grounds trust signals. Referenced as a model, not a name-drop -- always in context of solving the vendor coordination problem.

- [x] **CTAs use commercial language.** "Request Site Assessment" (primary on all commercial pages). "Schedule Property Walkthrough" (secondary alternative). "Get Seasonal Contract Details" (snow-specific). "Check Availability" (residential -- signals limited capacity). "Discuss Your Project" (hardscapes). Zero instances of "Get a Quote" or "Contact Us" remain.

- [x] **Service hierarchy is commercial-first.** Homepage cards: (1) Commercial Grounds, (2) Snow & Ice, (3) Hardscapes, (4) Residential. Navigation should match this order. Estate & Acreage merged into Residential. Snow page leads with commercial (dark card), residential secondary (light card).

- [x] **Brand voice maintained: professional, grounded, warm, sharp.** Professional: contract language, insurance specifics, structured processes. Grounded: real numbers, real client (Mike's Carwash), local geography named. Warm: owner accessibility, "let us earn your business," "no hard feelings." Sharp: "your property does not take the winter off," "national chains learn your property by reading a binder," "no finger-pointing when something goes wrong."

## Implementation Notes for Website Build Agent

### Priority of Changes (what to implement first)

1. **Hero section** -- highest-impact change, first thing visitors see
2. **Service card order** -- restructure to 4 cards, commercial-first
3. **All CTA text** -- global find-and-replace "Request a Quote" with "Request Site Assessment"
4. **WhyUs section** -- rewrite all 6 cards using copy above
5. **Trust bar** -- update from generic to specific ($2M, documented, 4-hour, Mike's)
6. **Snow page** -- update hero CTA, add Mike's reference to integration section, adjust residential weight
7. **Commercial Grounds page** -- if building new, use Section 4B copy directly
8. **Hardscapes page** -- if building new, use Section 4D copy
9. **About page** -- if building new, use Section 4E copy

### CTA Component Updates

The `CTA.tsx` component currently defaults to:
- Title: "Ready to get started?"
- Description: "Request a quote for your property..."
- Button: "Request a Quote"

**Update defaults to:**
- Title: "Protect your property year-round."
- Description: "Request a site assessment and receive a custom proposal with fixed annual pricing. No obligation. Response within 4 hours."
- Button: "Request Site Assessment"

### Meta/SEO Updates

**Homepage meta:**
```
Title: Stone & Salt | Commercial Grounds Management | Greater Cincinnati
Description: Year-round commercial grounds management and snow removal in Greater
Cincinnati. One vendor. Four seasons. Documented service. $2M insured.
```

**Snow page meta:**
```
Title: Commercial Snow & Ice Management | Stone & Salt | Cincinnati
Description: GPS-documented commercial snow removal in Greater Cincinnati. Seasonal
contracts, 24/7 response, $2M liability coverage. Trusted by Mike's Carwash.
```

**Commercial Grounds meta:**
```
Title: Commercial Grounds Management | Stone & Salt | Cincinnati
Description: Year-round grounds maintenance for office parks, retail centers, and
commercial properties. Annual contracts from $12K-$60K. Documented service.
4-hour response guarantee.
```

### Phone Number Note

All copy uses (513) 555-0123 as placeholder. The concept brief flags this as needing a real number before launch. The website build agent should use a variable or constant for the phone number so it can be updated in one place.

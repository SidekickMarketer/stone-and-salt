# Step 4 Review: Research vs. Build Gap Analysis
## February 15, 2026

---

## 1. SURPRISES

What the deep research found that the agents probably did not have when building.

### 1A. Equipment Strategy is Fundamentally Wrong in the Concept Brief

**Research finding:** The equipment research (`research-equipment-tractors.md`) concludes that a commercial 60" zero-turn mower should be the primary acquisition -- NOT a sub-compact tractor. The TCO analysis shows that using a tractor as the primary mower costs $17,000-$23,000 MORE over 5 years when operator time is valued, because tractors mow at 2.0 acres/hour vs. 3.5 acres/hour for commercial zero-turns.

**What the build assumed:** The concept brief, financial model, and earlier research summary (`RESEARCH-EQUIPMENT-COMPETITORS-RESULTS.md`) all assumed buying a used sub-compact tractor for $16,000-$17,000 as the primary equipment investment. The financial model budgets $16,500 for a "used compact tractor" and $450/month payments.

**Impact:** The financial model's equipment line item may need restructuring. A Scag Turf Tiger II 61" at $17,099 (dealer sale price) is actually cheaper than a JD 1025R package at $27,195 -- and produces revenue faster. The recommended strategy is: buy the zero-turn as primary revenue tool, rent a tractor for episodic loader work.

### 1B. Schill Grounds Management Was Acquired by Private Equity in January 2026

**Research finding:** `research-pricing-validation.md` reports that TruArc Partners acquired Schill from Argonne Capital Group, with the transaction completing January 13, 2026. This is a significant competitive development.

**What the build had:** The concept brief and website treat Schill as a static $50M regional competitor with 3.7 stars. No mention of the ownership change or its implications.

**Impact:** PE recapitalization of Schill will likely increase their sales pressure for multi-site portfolio deals, tighten their pricing discipline, and standardize their processes further. This is both a threat (more aggressive competitor) and an opportunity (organizational disruption creates unhappy clients). The About page and email outreach should acknowledge this dynamic without naming Schill directly -- "When your current vendor gets acquired by a private equity firm, you become an account number, not a property."

### 1C. GroundsPRO in West Chester was Acquired by Visterra Landscape Group

**Research finding:** `research-pricing-validation.md` identifies GroundsPRO as a West Chester-based commercial grounds competitor that was acquired by Visterra Landscape Group in early 2024.

**What the build had:** GroundsPRO is not mentioned anywhere in the concept brief, competitor analysis, or website copy. This is a direct competitor physically located in the primary service corridor.

**Impact:** Stone & Salt is now competing against TWO platform-backed commercial operators (Schill/TruArc and GroundsPRO/Visterra) in addition to BrightView and U.S. Lawns. The "owner-operated" positioning becomes even more powerful as consolidation accelerates, but the competitive landscape is more intense than the build materials acknowledge.

### 1D. Customer Acquisition Research Provides 20 Named Target Companies

**Research finding:** `research-customer-acquisition.md` provides a prioritized list of 20 specific companies (Towne Properties, Neyer Management, Anchor Associates, Phillips Edison, Steiner + Associates, etc.) with recommended contact approaches, first-ask scripts, and segment classification.

**What the build had:** The concept brief says "Target: 50 property management companies" and the email sequence addresses generic `{{firstName}}` at `{{city}}`, but no specific target list existed.

**Impact:** This is the single most actionable deliverable from the deep research. The 20 named companies, with recommended first-ask language, should be loaded directly into the outreach system. Several are high-leverage targets: Stonegate Property Management (200+ communities), Management Plus Realty Services (vendor registration portal), and Associa Real Property Management (Mason office).

### 1E. Ohio Minimum Wage Increase to $11/hour in January 2026

**Research finding:** `research-pricing-validation.md` cites Ohio's minimum wage increase to $11/hour (non-tipped) starting January 1, 2026.

**What the build had:** The financial model budgets crew wages at $18-$22/hour (well above minimum), but does not discuss the wage floor increase as a factor in competitor pricing or as a narrative tool for explaining price increases to clients.

**Impact:** Minor direct impact on Stone & Salt, but useful in pricing conversations: "Input costs have risen -- Ohio's minimum wage went up, salt prices are volatile, and the wage ladder has compressed. Our pricing reflects that reality."

### 1F. Bulk Salt Price is $96.40/ton from Butler County Procurement (May 2025)

**Research finding:** `research-pricing-validation.md` cites Butler County Engineer's Office bulk-treated sodium chloride at $96.40/ton (May 2025), up from $92.12 (July 2024) and $90.31 (July 2023).

**What the build had:** The RESEARCH-SUMMARY and financial model reference $67/ton (DOT rate) and $140+/ton (spot rates) from an earlier research document, but the Butler County procurement number ($96.40) is the most actionable local benchmark -- it is the price a qualified buyer pays through a competitive public bid.

**Impact:** The $96.40 number is more realistic than the $67 DOT rate for planning purposes. The financial model's salt sensitivity table should anchor on $96-$100/ton as the "realistic base," not $75/ton. This shifts the margin projections for snow contracts.

### 1G. Property Manager Close Rate on Proposals is ~51%

**Research finding:** `research-customer-acquisition.md` cites a large landscaping sales benchmark survey (190+ companies) reporting a ~51% close rate for commercial projects and ~47% for snow & ice at proposal stage.

**What the build had:** The financial model assumes a 15%+ close rate on proposals (Section 5F, Assumption #2), and models needing 40-55 proposals to hit 6-8 contracts.

**Impact:** The 15% close rate is a lead-to-contract rate (all stages), while the 51% is a proposal-to-contract rate (later stage only). These are consistent if early qualification/meeting/proposal filters eliminate ~70% of leads before a proposal is issued. The financial model's math holds, but the narrative should be clearer: "We need 40-55 conversations to yield 15-20 proposals, of which we close 8-10."

### 1H. LSA Verification Takes 3-4 Weeks

**Research finding:** `research-customer-acquisition.md` states Google screening/verification for LSAs commonly takes "about 3-4 weeks after you submit your verification documents."

**What the build had:** The concept brief lists "Set up Google Business Profile + LSA verification" as a Week 2 priority, implying quick activation.

**Impact:** If verification starts Week 2 (late February), LSAs may not go live until late March or early April. This means LSAs will NOT be generating leads during the critical first month of outreach. The timeline should plan for paid search (PPC) as a bridge, or accept that Month 1-2 inbound will come entirely from organic, direct mail, and outreach.

### 1I. Seasonal PPC Costs Swing Dramatically

**Research finding:** `research-customer-acquisition.md` reports landscaping PPC costs of ~$50/lead in spring, ~$100 in summer, and $200+ in winter.

**What the build had:** The financial model budgets $650/month flat for Google LSA/marketing. No seasonal adjustment.

**Impact:** Marketing spend should be front-loaded to spring (March-May) when CPL is lowest and demand is highest, then reduced in summer. The $650/month average is fine for budgeting, but execution should concentrate ~60% of annual spend in Q1-Q2.

### 1J. IFMA and IREM Chapters Exist Locally for Property Manager Networking

**Research finding:** `research-customer-acquisition.md` identifies the local IFMA chapter (facilities directors) and IREM Chapter 9 (Cincinnati/Dayton, real estate managers) as specific networking targets.

**What the build had:** The concept brief mentions "Direct Property Manager Outreach" but does not name specific organizations or networking channels.

**Impact:** Joining IFMA and/or IREM is a low-cost, high-leverage acquisition channel. Membership dues + events likely cost $500-$1,000/year and put Stone & Salt in recurring proximity to facilities leaders. This should be in the Month 1 action plan.

---

## 2. CONTRADICTIONS

### 2A. Equipment Strategy: Tractor vs. Zero-Turn

**Research says:** "Primary acquisition: buy (or finance) a commercial 60-61" zero-turn mower as the core revenue tool" and "Mowing throughput is often worth more than small differences in tractor package pricing." The 5-year economic TCO of a Scag 61" zero-turn + tractor rental is $71,172 vs. $86,527-$93,991 for any tractor-as-primary-mower option. (`research-equipment-tractors.md`, TCO tables)

**Build says:** The financial model budgets $16,500 for a "Used compact tractor (JD 1025R or Kubota BX2380)" with $450/month payments over 36 months. The concept brief lists "Compact tractor with 60+ inch mower deck" as the equipment gap. The RESEARCH-EQUIPMENT-COMPETITORS-RESULTS.md recommends "Buy used around $16,000-17,000."

**Verdict:** The earlier equipment research (RESULTS.md) was done before the deep tractor research. The deep research directly contradicts the "buy a used tractor" recommendation. The correct strategy is to buy a commercial zero-turn ($17,000-$18,000 new) and rent a tractor when needed ($135-$203/day). This actually REDUCES Day 1 capital requirements.

### 2B. Salt Cost Baseline

**Research says:** Butler County procurement: $96.40/ton (May 2025). Historical average context: $75/ton. Spot rates: $140+/ton. (`research-pricing-validation.md`)

**Build says:** The financial model uses $75/ton as "baseline" and $67/ton as "DOT rate" for the sensitivity analysis. The concept brief says "Bulk rock salt: $67/ton (DOT rate)."

**Verdict:** $75/ton is optimistic for 2026 planning. The Butler County procurement rate of $96.40/ton is a better baseline because it reflects what a local entity actually paid through competitive bidding in 2025. The difference is meaningful: at $96/ton vs. $75/ton, each $12,000 snow contract loses ~$600 in margin. Across 5 contracts, that is $3,000 -- not fatal, but the financial model's snow margin projections are overstated by approximately this amount.

### 2C. Pricing Range Confirmation vs. Pricing Tier Structure

**Research says:** Per-acre full-service commercial grounds pricing of $800-$1,600/acre/month is standard, with 28 vs. 32 visits being a core differentiator. Snow seasonal contracts of $5,000-$25,000+ with per-event of $350-$1,500+. The research explicitly says the $12K-$60K annual grounds range is "well-calibrated." (`research-pricing-validation.md`)

**Build says:** The commercial grounds page shows three tiers: Standard ($12,000-$25,000), Premium ($25,000-$45,000), Enterprise ($45,000-$60,000).

**Verdict:** No contradiction -- the research validates the range. However, the deep research surfaces a differentiation opportunity not reflected in the website: explicitly structuring tiers around visit frequency (28-visit vs. 32-visit equivalents) and making scope/exclusions transparent. The current tier descriptions focus on features (monthly reports, priority response, dedicated crew) but do not specify visit counts. This is the #1 thing property managers compare when evaluating bids.

### 2D. "Trusted by Mike's Carwash" on Website -- Missing from Trust Bar

**Brand audit says:** The hero trust bar should include "Trusted by Mike's Carwash" as the fourth trust signal. (`01-brand-copy-audit.md`, Section 2, Refined Homepage Hero)

**Website shows:** The hero trust bar has only 3 items: "$2M Liability Coverage", "Documented Service Logs", "4-Hour Response Guarantee". Mike's Carwash is not mentioned anywhere on the current live website.

**Verdict:** This is a build gap, not a research contradiction. The brand audit explicitly called for Mike's Carwash as a trust signal. The website build agent did not implement it. This needs to be added to the hero trust bar and to the snow page's year-round integration section.

### 2E. Snow Revenue as "Supplementary" vs. Financial Model Weighting

**Research says:** "Snow revenue is supplementary, NOT foundational" and "Cannot build business model primarily on snow income." Cincinnati averages 15-23 inches/year. (`RESEARCH-SUMMARY.md`)

**Financial model says:** Snow is 20% of Year 1 revenue ($65,000 of $325,000) and is modeled correctly as supplementary. Seasonal contracts pay regardless of snowfall.

**Verdict:** No real contradiction here. The financial model correctly positions snow as supplementary (20%), and seasonal contracts de-risk weather variability. The model is consistent with the research.

---

## 3. VALIDATED

### 3A. Pricing Ranges -- Fully Confirmed

The deep research (`research-pricing-validation.md`) explicitly validates:
- Commercial grounds annual contracts of $12,000-$60,000/year: "Your range is not 'high for Cincinnati' in 2025-2026 terms; it's consistent with per-acre benchmarks."
- Commercial snow seasonal contracts of $5,000-$25,000/season: "strongly supported by the Cincinnati-specific pricing guidance."
- Per-event snow pricing of $350-$1,500+: validated against Cincinnati-specific data.

These are the same numbers used throughout the website, financial model, and concept brief. Confidence: HIGH.

### 3B. "One Vendor, Year-Round" Positioning -- Validated as Market-Fit

The deep research confirms: "Your 'one vendor / four seasons' concept maps directly onto what the largest commercial specialists are selling... the opportunity is not proving that 'one vendor' matters -- it's proving your version of it reduces operational risk more than the others." (`research-pricing-validation.md`)

The hero headline "One vendor. Four seasons. Zero coverage gaps." is validated as the correct strategic frame.

### 3C. Competitor Landscape -- Confirmed and Enriched

The deep research confirms the same top competitors (Schill, GroundSystems, Wimberg, BrightView, U.S. Lawns) and adds new intelligence:
- Schill PE acquisition (new intel, January 2026)
- GroundsPRO/Visterra acquisition (new intel)
- Wimberg's east-side focus may limit overlap with north-suburb corridor
- Werbrich's is residential-focused, not a direct commercial competitor

### 3D. Documentation/Liability Positioning -- Strongly Validated

The research validates documentation as a core differentiator: "Cincinnati enforces sidewalk snow responsibilities through municipal authority backed by state code" and recommends "time-stamped service logs, trigger definitions, pre-treatment plans, and post-event reporting." (`research-pricing-validation.md`)

The website already leads with documented service throughout (hero trust bar, WhyUs cards, commercial grounds page, snow page). This is correct.

### 3E. Outbound Multi-Touch Approach -- Confirmed as Best Practice

The customer acquisition research validates the multi-channel outbound approach:
- Cold email: 1-5% reply rate
- Cold calling: 4.82% meeting-book rate
- Direct mail: 2.7-4.4% response rate
- LinkedIn: 65% of InMail responses arrive within 24 hours

The brand audit's 3-email sequence is consistent with these benchmarks and the projected 2-4% meeting-booked rate from 50 companies.

### 3F. CAC Economics -- Confirmed as Extraordinary

The deep research validates that commercial LTV:CAC ratios are extremely favorable: even at the most expensive channel (PPC at $880 CAC), the ratio is 195:1 against a $172,000 CLV. This confirms the financial model's assertion that "virtually any channel that produces commercial leads is worth investing in."

### 3G. Service Area Geography -- Confirmed

The deep research's customer acquisition targets align perfectly with the website's service area pages: Blue Ash, West Chester, Mason, Liberty Township. The research also identifies specific developments (Liberty Center, Summit Park/Blue Ash) as target properties.

### 3H. Brand Voice and Copy Direction -- Validated by Competitor Analysis

The deep research confirms that major competitors use consultative/proposal funnels rather than published pricing, which validates Stone & Salt's "Request Site Assessment" CTA approach. The emphasis on documentation, response guarantees, and owner accessibility all match competitive gaps identified in the research.

---

## 4. GAPS IN THE BUILD

### 4A. Mike's Carwash Reference -- Missing from Website

The brand audit explicitly calls for "Trusted by Mike's Carwash" in the hero trust bar, the snow page integration section, and throughout outreach. The RESEARCH-EQUIPMENT-COMPETITORS-RESULTS.md confirms a signed Mike's Carwash contract. Yet the website has zero mentions of Mike's Carwash anywhere.

**Fix needed:** Add "Trusted by Mike's Carwash" to the hero trust bar as the 4th signal. Add a Mike's Carwash reference to the snow page's "Year-Round Service" integration section. This requires permission from Mike's Carwash first.

### 4B. Contract Structure Differentiation -- Not on Website

The deep research surfaces a powerful differentiation opportunity: "package tiers that are explicitly '28-visit' vs. '32-visit' equivalents, plus a transparent add-on menu." (`research-pricing-validation.md`)

The current commercial grounds page shows three tiers (Standard, Premium, Enterprise) differentiated by features (reports, priority response, dedicated crew) but NOT by visit frequency or scope transparency.

**Fix needed:** Update tier descriptions to include visit counts, season length, and explicit inclusions/exclusions. This is how property managers actually compare bids.

### 4C. Snow Contract Architecture Options -- Not Presented

The deep research recommends offering two snow contract structures: "A 'fixed seasonal' (max predictability) and a 'readiness + per-inch/per-event variable' (shared risk, potentially lower base)." (`research-pricing-validation.md`)

The snow page mentions "Seasonal contracts for budget certainty or per-event pricing when you need flexibility" but does not explain the hybrid readiness+variable option.

**Fix needed:** Add a brief explanation of the two contract architectures on the snow page. Property managers who have experienced variable-cost winters will immediately recognize the value of the readiness fee model.

### 4D. Salt Surcharge Clause -- Not Mentioned on Website

The financial model correctly identifies salt surcharge clauses as critical ("Every snow contract MUST include a salt surcharge clause"), but the website makes no mention of how material cost volatility is handled.

**Fix needed:** Add a brief note in the snow page commercial section or FAQ: "Material costs based on pre-season bulk rates. Contracts include transparent material cost provisions so there are no mid-season surprises for either party." This signals professionalism and protects margins.

### 4E. Industry Association Memberships and Certifications -- Not on Website

The RESEARCH-SUMMARY.md identifies SIMA (Snow & Ice Management Association) and ASCA SN 9001 certifications as trust signals. The customer acquisition research identifies IFMA and IREM chapter memberships as networking channels.

The website does not mention any industry certifications or association memberships.

**Fix needed:** Once obtained, add SIMA CSP certification and IFMA/IREM membership logos to the trust signals sections. Before obtaining them, add "Pursuing SIMA Certified Snow Professional certification" to the snow page to signal industry engagement.

### 4F. Named Target Companies -- No Outbound Infrastructure

The deep research provides 20 specific target companies with recommended first-ask scripts. The email sequence from the brand audit is ready (3 emails via Instantly.ai). But there is no indication that these targets have been loaded into any CRM or outreach tool.

**Fix needed:** This is an operational gap, not a website gap. The 20 companies need to be entered into the CRM with the recommended contact approaches and scheduled for outreach starting immediately.

### 4G. Referral Program Structure -- Not Defined

The customer acquisition research provides specific referral fee benchmarks (1-5% for low-involvement, flat $250-$1,000 per contract) and recommended timing (after first proof milestone). The concept brief mentions referrals as a channel but does not define the program.

**Fix needed:** Define the referral program: $500 per signed annual contract (paid after first invoice clears), or charitable donation in referrer's name for organizations with ethics policies. Add a "Refer a Property" page or section to the website.

### 4H. Budget Season Targeting -- Missing from GTM Plan

The customer acquisition research identifies Q4 as when commercial PMs set next year's budgets. The email sequence does mention "I'll check back in Q4 when you're planning next year's budget" (Email 3), but there is no systematic plan for Q4 budget-season outreach.

**Fix needed:** The operations system (not built by any agent) should include a Q4 campaign calendar: September start for snow contracts, October-November for next-year grounds proposals. This is when Year 2 pipeline gets built.

### 4I. HOA Bid Cycle Awareness -- Missing from Copy

The customer acquisition research notes that HOA landscape contracts are typically bid out every 3-5 years, and the best entry strategy is becoming an auxiliary vendor first (enhancements, snow, storm cleanup) to position for the full contract.

The website's commercial grounds page and contact form do not distinguish between "new property needing a vendor" vs. "existing property with an incumbent" vs. "HOA re-bidding cycle."

**Fix needed:** Add a FAQ on the commercial grounds page: "What if we already have a vendor?" with an answer about auxiliary services, contract renewal timing, and how Stone & Salt positions for the next cycle. This shows sophistication.

### 4J. Escalation Caps for Multi-Year Agreements -- Not Mentioned

The deep research recommends "pre-defined escalation caps for multi-year agreements (or indexed material surcharges) rather than renegotiating emotionally mid-season." (`research-pricing-validation.md`)

The website mentions "fixed annual pricing" but does not address multi-year agreements or how price adjustments work at renewal.

**Fix needed:** Add to the commercial grounds page or contract details: "Multi-year agreements available with pre-defined annual adjustment caps." This signals long-term thinking and sophistication.

---

## 5. GAPS IN THE RESEARCH

### 5A. Actual Competitor Pricing -- Still Unknown

All three deep research reports confirm that "most established competitors in this market do not publish simple price lists." No actual competitor quotes or pricing was obtained. The research validates Stone & Salt's ranges against industry benchmarks, not against what Schill or GroundSystems actually charges for a specific lot.

**What we still need:** Mystery-shop 2-3 competitors by requesting proposals for a real or realistic commercial property. This would provide the only true pricing comparison available.

### 5B. Insurance Costs and Availability -- Not Researched

The concept brief budgets $3,000-$4,500/year for $2M GL insurance. No deep research validated this assumption or identified insurance carriers for commercial landscaping/snow operations in Ohio.

**What we still need:** 2-3 insurance quotes from commercial landscaping specialty carriers. Snow operations carry higher liability risk and may push premiums above the budgeted range. Workers' comp rates for landscaping classifications in Ohio also need verification.

### 5C. Specific Property Management Company Vendor Onboarding Requirements

The customer acquisition research identifies target companies and recommended first-ask scripts, but does not reveal specific vendor requirements: What insurance minimums do they require? What documentation standards? What bid format?

**What we still need:** Call 3-5 target property management companies and ask about their vendor registration process. This pre-qualifies Stone & Salt before the first pitch and reveals table-stakes requirements.

### 5D. Subcontractor/Overflow Capacity

None of the research addresses what happens if Stone & Salt lands more contracts than it can service with a 2-person team. The financial model models hiring at Month 5, but what if a large contract comes in Month 2?

**What we still need:** Identify 1-2 trusted subcontractors who could handle overflow for both grounds and snow. This is a contingency that allows saying "yes" to opportunities before crew capacity is fully built.

### 5E. Technology Stack for Service Documentation

The website promises "GPS-tracked, timestamped service documentation" and "service logs available on request." No research or operations document specifies what technology stack delivers this (Jobber? Aspire? LMN? Custom?).

**What we still need:** Select and implement a field service management platform that produces timestamped GPS logs and photo documentation. This is a pre-launch requirement -- the website makes promises the technology has to keep.

### 5F. Legal Review of Contract Templates

No research covers the legal structure of commercial grounds maintenance or snow removal contracts in Ohio. Key questions: What indemnification language is standard? What hold-harmless provisions do property managers expect? What dispute resolution mechanisms?

**What we still need:** Have a commercial contracts attorney draft or review the annual maintenance contract and seasonal snow contract templates before the first proposal goes out.

### 5G. Local Permit and Regulatory Requirements for Snow Operations

The RESEARCH-SUMMARY mentions no general landscaping license is required in Ohio, but does not address specific snow operations regulations: salt application permits, stormwater runoff compliance, ADA clearance standards for sidewalks.

**What we still need:** Verify there are no local (Butler County or municipal) salt application restrictions or snow operations permits required.

---

## 6. AGENT RE-RUN RECOMMENDATIONS

### Brand & Copy Audit Agent
- **What would change:** The email sequence could incorporate the 20 named target companies from the customer acquisition research. The messaging could add the "contract clarity" differentiation (28 vs. 32 visits) as a positioning angle. The copy could reference the PE consolidation wave as a reason to choose owner-operated.
- **Specific data points to incorporate:** 20 named targets, IFMA/IREM as networking channels, 28-vs-32-visit differentiation, Schill PE acquisition narrative, referral program structure.
- **RE-RUN? NO.** The brand audit is solid and 90% of it was implemented correctly on the website. The gaps are additive (add Mike's Carwash, add visit-count differentiation) rather than requiring a full re-run. A targeted edit pass handles this.

### Financial Model Agent
- **What would change:** Equipment line item should reflect a commercial zero-turn ($17,000-$18,000) instead of a used tractor ($16,500). Salt cost baseline should shift from $75/ton to $96/ton. Marketing spend should be seasonally adjusted. The monthly cash flow table's equipment payment and material cost lines would shift.
- **Specific data points to incorporate:** Zero-turn vs. tractor TCO analysis, Butler County salt at $96.40/ton, seasonal PPC cost variation ($50 spring vs. $200 winter), 3-4 week LSA verification delay.
- **RE-RUN? YES -- but targeted.** The model's overall structure is sound (revenue ramp, cash flow timing, sensitivity analysis). What needs updating: (1) equipment cost line, (2) salt baseline in snow margin calculations, (3) marketing seasonality. A full re-run is overkill; update the three specific line items and the sensitivity tables. Estimated effort: 1-2 hours of manual editing vs. a full agent re-run.

### Website Build Agent
- **What pages/sections would change:**
  - Hero trust bar: add "Trusted by Mike's Carwash" (4th signal)
  - Commercial grounds page: add visit-count language to tier descriptions, add FAQ about incumbent vendors and HOA bid cycles, add multi-year agreement mention
  - Snow page: add hybrid contract architecture explanation, add salt surcharge FAQ, add Mike's Carwash reference in integration section
  - About page: no significant changes needed
  - Contact form: consider adding "How did you hear about us?" tracking field
- **RE-RUN? NO.** The website is well-built, commercially positioned, and architecturally sound. A targeted edit pass (2-3 hours) to add the missing elements is more efficient than a full re-run that risks breaking what works. The gaps are all additive (add content) rather than structural (wrong architecture).

### Design Agent
- **Any design implications:** The deep research does not change any design decisions. The color palette, typography, layout, and component architecture are all validated by the commercial-primary positioning.
- **RE-RUN? NO.** The design review correctly identifies real photography as the biggest remaining credibility gap. No research finding changes the visual direction.

### NEW AGENTS NEEDED?

**Operations Agent -- YES, should be run.**
- The original pipeline called for an Operations Systems agent (Agent 2) to produce: lead qualification framework, CRM setup, proposal template structure, follow-up sequences, and service documentation system.
- This agent was either never run or its output is missing from `/output/`. The output directory has `01-brand-copy-audit.md`, `02-financial-model.md`, `03-design-review.md` -- note that `02` is the financial model, not operations.
- **What it would produce:** CRM configuration (GHL or Jobber), proposal templates with the 28/32-visit tier structure, service documentation technology selection, follow-up cadence for the 3-6 month sales cycle, Q4 budget-season campaign calendar.
- **Priority:** HIGH. Without operations systems, the website generates leads with nowhere to go.

**GTM/Launch Agent -- YES, should be run.**
- An agent that takes the 20 named target companies, the email sequence, the IFMA/IREM networking recommendations, and the seasonal PPC strategy and produces a 90-day launch calendar with specific daily/weekly actions.
- **What it would produce:** Week-by-week action plan for March-May 2026, loaded target list, outreach cadence, marketing spend allocation, milestone checkpoints.
- **Priority:** HIGH. This is the bridge between strategy and execution.

**Legal/Compliance Agent -- NICE TO HAVE.**
- Contract template drafting, insurance procurement checklist, Ohio regulatory compliance verification.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM. Can be handled by a local attorney rather than an agent.

## 7. STRONGEST SIGNAL

**The equipment strategy is wrong, and it is easy to fix.**

The deep tractor research definitively shows that buying a commercial zero-turn mower ($17,000-$18,000 new, with commercial warranty) and renting a tractor for episodic work ($135-$203/day) saves $17,000-$23,000 over 5 years compared to buying a tractor as the primary mowing platform. More importantly, it saves 180 hours per year in mowing time -- time that can be spent on sales, site assessments, and client management during the critical first year.

This finding is easy to act on (buy a different piece of equipment), costs the same or less upfront, and directly impacts the two most constrained resources in Year 1: time and cash.

---

## 8. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Change equipment acquisition plan to commercial zero-turn.** Get 2-3 dealer quotes for John Deere Z900 series or Exmark Lazer Z X-Series 60". Establish a tractor rental account for loader work. **Effort: 2-3 hours of dealer calls.** Priority: P0.

2. **Load 20 target companies into CRM.** Take the list from `research-customer-acquisition.md` and enter them with recommended contact approaches. Begin outreach this week. **Effort: 2-3 hours.** Priority: P0.

3. **Add "Trusted by Mike's Carwash" to website hero.** One code change to add the 4th trust signal to the hero section and the snow page. Requires confirming permission from Mike's Carwash. **Effort: 15 minutes of code + 1 phone call for permission.** Priority: P1.

4. **Submit LSA verification documents.** The 3-4 week verification timeline means every day of delay pushes lead generation back. **Effort: 1-2 hours to gather documents and submit.** Priority: P0.

### This Month (February-March)

5. **Update financial model's three line items.** Equipment ($17K zero-turn vs. $16.5K tractor), salt baseline ($96/ton vs. $75/ton), marketing seasonality. **Effort: 1-2 hours.** Priority: P1.

6. **Run Operations Agent.** Produce CRM configuration, proposal templates, service documentation technology selection, and follow-up cadences. **Effort: Agent run, ~30 minutes of prompting + review.** Priority: P1.

7. **Run GTM/Launch Agent.** Produce 90-day launch calendar with daily/weekly actions. **Effort: Agent run, ~30 minutes of prompting + review.** Priority: P1.

8. **Join IFMA or IREM local chapter.** Register for the next event. **Effort: 1 hour + membership fee ($200-$500).** Priority: P2.

9. **Update commercial grounds page tiers.** Add visit-count language (28 vs. 32 visits), scope transparency, and multi-year agreement mention. Add FAQ about incumbent vendors. **Effort: 1-2 hours of code edits.** Priority: P2.

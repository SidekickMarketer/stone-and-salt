# Stone & Salt -- Brand Refinement
## Post-Competitive Audit | February 15, 2026

---

**Verdict from the audit:** The brand is already in whitespace. No redesign needed. This document REFINES and SHARPENS. It does not rebuild.

**Three gaps to close:**
1. New-company narrative (every competitor flexes 10-90 years)
2. Photography direction (branded placeholders need a plan for real photos)
3. Headline font consideration (Montserrat works but is not distinctive)

**Additional refinements from the gap analysis:**
- PE consolidation wave positioning
- Contract clarity messaging (28 vs 32 visits)
- Updated email outreach with deep research findings

## 1. New-Company Narrative Framework

### The Problem

Every competitor in the Cincinnati commercial grounds market leads with longevity:
- Wimberg: "45+ years"
- Engledow: "Since 1932"
- Schill: "30+ years"
- Yellowstone: "Since 2008"
- BrightView: decades of scale

Stone & Salt has zero years. In a B2B environment where property managers are risk-averse and personally accountable for vendor performance, "we are new" is the single biggest trust barrier. It cannot be ignored. It must be addressed head-on.

### The Counter-Position: "Built to Fix What They Still Get Wrong"

The narrative is not "we are new." The narrative is "we are purpose-built." Every competitor inherited systems, habits, processes, and organizational debt from a previous era. Stone & Salt started with a blank page and designed every system around what property managers actually need in 2026.

**The core line:**

> "We didn't inherit a business. We built one to fix what the 40-year incumbents still get wrong."

**Supporting lines (use across channels):**

> "New company. New standards. Same accountability every visit."

> "Your current vendor was new once too. The difference is we started with the systems they still haven't built."

> "We don't have 40 years of history. But we also don't have 40 years of bad habits."

> "Every system we run -- documentation, GPS tracking, response protocols -- was designed from Day 1. Not retrofitted after a lawsuit."

### The PE Consolidation Angle

This is the sharpest version of the new-company narrative. Two of Stone & Salt's direct competitors have been acquired by private equity platforms in the last 24 months:

- **Schill Grounds Management** -- acquired by TruArc Partners (completed January 13, 2026, from Argonne Capital Group)
- **GroundsPRO** -- acquired by Visterra Landscape Group (early 2024, West Chester based)

This is not speculation. This is public record. And it creates a structural opening for Stone & Salt.

**What happens when a PE firm acquires a landscape company:**
- The account manager who knew your property by heart gets replaced or reassigned
- Service decisions get routed through a corporate playbook, not a person who has walked your lot
- Pricing discipline tightens -- not for your benefit, but for EBITDA targets
- Crews rotate more frequently as the platform "optimizes" labor across its portfolio
- Your property goes from being a relationship to being a line item on a spreadsheet

**How to use this without naming competitors:**

> "When your grounds vendor gets acquired by an investment firm, you stop being a property and start being a portfolio number. We are the opposite: owner-operated, locally accountable, and not for sale."

> "The commercial landscape industry is consolidating. Investment firms are buying up regional operators and standardizing service. If you've noticed your vendor feeling more corporate lately, there's a reason."

> "We built Stone & Salt because we saw the trend: regional operators getting bought out, account managers getting replaced, property managers getting voicemail trees instead of the person who used to pick up the phone."

**Rule:** Never name Schill, GroundsPRO, Visterra, or TruArc directly in outward-facing copy. The audience will fill in the blanks. Naming them looks petty. The structural argument is more powerful than the accusation.

### Copy Blocks by Context

#### About Page -- "Why We Started" Section

```
Headline:     We didn't inherit a business.
              We built one to fix what the incumbents still get wrong.

Body:         The commercial grounds industry in Cincinnati is consolidating.
              Regional operators are being acquired by investment firms. Account
              managers are being replaced by corporate playbooks. Property managers
              are getting voicemail trees where they used to get a person.

              We started Stone & Salt because we saw that happening -- and because
              the alternative was not any better. National chains earn 1.3 stars
              because they treat your property like a line item. One-truck operators
              disappear when it snows. Nobody was building a company designed from
              Day 1 around what property managers actually need: documented service,
              predictable budgets, and a decision-maker who answers the phone.

              We are not trying to be the biggest grounds management company in
              Cincinnati. We are trying to be the one you never have to think about
              switching away from.
```

#### Homepage -- "Why Not Us" Callout Box

```
Headline:     We're the new company asking for your trust.

Body:         We know what you're thinking. Every vendor on your short list has
              10, 20, 40 years of history. We have documented processes, $2M in
              liability coverage, GPS-tracked service logs, and the direct cell
              number of an owner who built this company to solve the problems
              your current vendor still has.

              We don't have decades of history. But we also don't have decades
              of the bad habits that come with it.

              Let our work speak first. Schedule a site assessment and judge us
              on the walkthrough, the proposal, and the first 90 days of service.
```

#### Proposals -- Opening Paragraph

```
Stone & Salt is a year-round grounds management company built specifically for
commercial properties in Greater Cincinnati. We are owner-operated -- not a
franchise, not a subsidiary of an investment firm, and not a residential company
that "also does commercial." Every system we run, from GPS-documented service
logs to our 4-hour response guarantee, was designed from the ground up for
property managers who need reliability they can verify, not just promise.
```

#### Sales Conversations -- How to Handle "How Long Have You Been in Business?"

This question will come up in every sales conversation. Do not dodge it. Do not minimize it. Address it with confidence and immediately redirect to proof.

**The framework: Acknowledge, Reframe, Prove.**

Script:

> "We launched in [year]. So we're newer than some of the names you're evaluating. That's fair. But here's what we built from Day 1 that most of those companies still don't have: every visit GPS-documented with timestamps and photos. A 4-hour response guarantee in writing. $2M liability coverage with your property named as additional insured. And when you call, you get an owner, not a dispatcher.

> "I'd rather show you what we can do than tell you how long we've been doing it. Let me walk your property, put together a proposal, and let the specifics speak for themselves."

**If they push further:**

> "Your current vendor was probably new at some point too. The question isn't how many years someone has been around -- it's whether they've built the systems to protect your property and make your job easier. We can show you exactly how we do that."

**The underlying psychology:** Property managers who ask about years are really asking about risk. They are asking: "Will you disappear? Will you screw up my property? Will I have to explain to my boss why I hired the new company?" Answer the fear, not the question.

## 2. Photography Creative Brief

### Why This Is Critical

The competitive audit found that Stone & Salt's visual identity -- palette, typography, design effects -- is already in whitespace. But the audit also found that without real photography, this advantage is theoretical. The brand "looks like a boutique hotel brand or premium architecture firm" on paper, but it needs to look like a boots-on-the-ground operation in practice.

Every competitor uses the same photography template: bright midday shots of perfect green lawns. Nobody shows human faces. Nobody shows dawn or dusk. Nobody shows the work in progress. This is the opening.

### What Makes Stone & Salt Photography Different (The Rules)

1. **Atmospheric lighting, not catalogue lighting.** Dawn, dusk, golden hour, overcast. Avoid flat midday sun. The mood should feel earned, not staged.

2. **Documentary style, not portfolio style.** Show the work happening, not just the result. Boots in mulch. Salt truck rolling at 4 AM. Crew loading equipment before sunrise. This matches the "boots not brochure" voice.

3. **Human faces with names.** The owner inspecting a property. A crew lead directing a mow route. If a face appears, it belongs to a real Stone & Salt person. Not stock actors.

4. **Seasonal variety.** Every competitor looks like eternal spring. Stone & Salt should cycle through all four seasons visually. Winter storm operations are just as important as summer maintenance.

5. **Warm tones that match the palette.** Post-processing should lean warm (consistent with Soft Cream and Sun-Ochre) rather than the oversaturated greens every competitor uses. Desaturate greens slightly. Let earth tones come forward.

6. **Properties with context, not properties in isolation.** Show the building or tenants in the background. Show a parking lot with cars -- not an empty lot that looks like a staged photo. Show the property as a place where people work.

### Shot List (Priority Order)

#### Priority 1: Needed Before Launch

| Shot | Direction | Mood | Technical Notes |
|------|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **Owner on a commercial property** | One of the partners walking a property, clipboard or tablet in hand, inspecting the grounds. Mid-conversation with a property manager if possible. Eye contact with camera in at least one frame. | Confident, professional, approachable. Not stiff. Not posed. | Golden hour preferred. Shoot at Mike's Carwash or a partner's property. Include the building facade in the background for commercial context. |
| **Crew and equipment at dawn** | Trucks and trailer loaded, equipment visible (zero-turn, tools), crew ready. Shot from a low angle to make the operation feel substantial. Pre-sunrise or early dawn light. | Grit, purpose, readiness. The "we were here before you woke up" shot. | Blue-hour or first light. Include the Stone & Salt truck lettering if vehicles are branded. If not branded yet, focus on equipment and crew silhouettes. |
| **Active mowing on a commercial property** | Zero-turn mower in action on a commercial lawn. Crisp stripes visible. Building in background with cars in the lot (active property, not vacant). | Competence, precision. | Mid-morning or late afternoon light. Shoot from an elevated angle to show the stripe pattern. Include the property's context (signage, building). |
| **Snow operations -- plowing** | Plow truck clearing a commercial lot. Salt application visible. Headlights on. Snow falling or recently fallen. | Urgency, capability, reliability. "We are here when it matters most." | Pre-dawn or during the storm. The harsher the conditions, the better the shot. Aim for the contrast between the cleared path and the uncleared area. |
| **Snow operations -- sidewalk clearing** | Crew member clearing a commercial sidewalk or building entrance. Visible breath in cold air. Building entrance and ADA-compliant path visible. | Thoroughness, care, detail work. | Early morning before tenant arrival. Include the building entrance so the viewer understands this is a commercial setting. |

#### Priority 2: Within First 90 Days

| Shot | Direction | Mood | Technical Notes |
|------|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **Service documentation in action** | Owner or crew lead holding a tablet or phone showing the documentation system. Property visible behind them. GPS/timestamp interface partially visible on screen. | Technology meets fieldwork. The documentation promise visualized. | This is the most category-breaking shot in the set. No competitor has anything like it. Ensure the screen is legible enough to see structure (timestamps, photos) but not so sharp it reveals proprietary details. |
| **Seasonal bed maintenance** | Crew member mulching or planting annuals in a commercial bed. Close-up of hands in soil, tool work. Property signage or building in soft focus behind. | Craft, attention to detail. Not glamorous -- real work. | Spring or early summer. Shallow depth of field to focus on the hands/work with property context blurred behind. |
| **Before/after comparison** | Split-frame or side-by-side of a property before Stone & Salt service and after 30 days. Same angle, same property, different condition. | Transformation through consistent service, not a one-time "makeover." | Use the same tripod position and time of day for both shots. The "before" should not be a disaster -- it should look like what happens when a mediocre vendor does the minimum. The "after" should look maintained, not manicured to unrealistic standards. |
| **Property at dusk** | A well-maintained commercial property shot at dusk. Landscape lighting on (if applicable). Warm interior light from building windows. Grounds immaculate. | Premium, atmospheric, different from every competitor's bright-midday shot. This is the hero-image contender. | Blue hour. Tripod essential. Long exposure if needed for lighting balance. This shot becomes the homepage hero image. |
| **Seasonal transition -- fall cleanup** | Crew performing fall leaf cleanup on a commercial property. Leaves being blown, collected, removed. Autumn color visible. | Year-round commitment. The "we don't disappear after Labor Day" visual. | October-November. The warm tones of fall foliage naturally complement the Stone & Salt palette (ochre, warm cream). |

#### Priority 3: For Growth and Content

| Shot | Direction | Mood | Technical Notes |
|------|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **The handshake / site walkthrough** | Owner and a property manager walking a property together, discussing the grounds. Not a posed handshake -- a candid moment during a walkthrough. | Partnership, professionalism, consultative selling. | Shoot during a real site assessment if possible. Candid > posed. |
| **Equipment detail shots** | Close-ups of equipment: clean mower deck, salt spreader, plow edge, branded hard hats or vests. | Quality of tools, pride in equipment. | Studio-style lighting on equipment, or natural light in the shop. These become website accent images and social content. |
| **The crew photo** | Full crew, casual but professional. On-site or in front of equipment. Real people, real names. | Team, pride, accountability. "These are the people who manage your property." | Not overly posed. Standing near equipment or at a property. Include first names in the caption when used on the website. |
| **Aerial / drone property shots** | Drone footage of a commercial property being serviced. Shows scale, stripe patterns, property layout. | Scale, professionalism, capability. | Midday is acceptable for aerial (shadows define terrain). Include the property's context -- surrounding roads, buildings, parking areas. |

### Interim Improvements to Current Placeholders

Until real photography is available, these adjustments reduce the gap:

1. **Remove any stock photography that shows people.** Stock people immediately undermine "boots not brochure." Replace with design-heavy hero images (gradient overlays on texture, abstract patterns using the brand palette) or equipment-only shots if any real equipment photos exist.

2. **If placeholder images must stay, add a warm color overlay.** Use a Soft Cream or Sun-Ochre semi-transparent overlay at 15-25% opacity. This at least makes the stock imagery feel consistent with the brand palette rather than generic.

3. **Use the design system's strengths.** The glassmorphism, noise texture, warm shadows, and gradient effects in the current CSS are already distinctive. Lean on these design elements harder until real photos replace them. A well-designed "texture hero" with strong typography is better than a stock photo that looks like every competitor.

4. **Add a "Photos coming soon" honesty signal.** On the About page: "We are a new company. Our photos will be of our actual crews, equipment, and properties -- not stock imagery. Check back as we build." This matches the "boots not brochure" transparency and turns a weakness into a brand-consistent moment.

## 3. Typography Recommendation

### The Question

Montserrat + Open Sans is the current combination. The competitive audit found it "adequate but not distinctive." The question is whether upgrading the headline font is worth the effort at this stage.

### The Options Evaluated

#### Option A: Keep Montserrat (No Change)

**Pros:**
- Already implemented across the entire site
- Zero engineering effort, zero risk of breaking layouts
- Widely available on Google Fonts, fast loading
- Montserrat's geometric forms are professional and clean

**Cons:**
- Used on thousands of websites. Not distinctive.
- Does not contribute to the "premium" feel the brand is trying to create
- Looks like the safe choice -- which is exactly what every competitor also chose

**Verdict:** Safe. Adequate. Not a differentiator.

#### Option B: DM Serif Display

**Pros:**
- Serif headlines would be completely unique in this competitive set. Zero competitors use serifs.
- DM Serif Display has a warm, confident character that matches the brand voice
- The contrast between serif headlines and sans-serif body creates visual hierarchy
- Reads "architecture firm" or "boutique hospitality" -- exactly the premium feel the brand targets
- Available on Google Fonts. Free.

**Cons:**
- Serif fonts read "traditional" to some audiences. Could feel stuffy if not paired with modern layout and color.
- Requires testing across all headline sizes and breakpoints. Headlines that wrap may behave differently.
- The warm character works for large display sizes but becomes less distinctive at smaller heading levels (H4, H5).

**How it would feel in context:**

```
DM Serif Display at H1:
"One vendor. Four seasons. Zero liability gaps."
-- Feels confident, editorial, premium. Stands out immediately.

DM Serif Display at H2:
"Your property managed. Your liability documented."
-- Still strong. The serif adds weight to a statement that already has authority.

DM Serif Display in navigation:
"Commercial Grounds | Snow & Ice | Hardscapes"
-- Would NOT use in navigation. Navigation stays Open Sans (or a clean sans-serif).
  DM Serif Display is a display font -- use it for headlines only.
```

**Verdict:** The strongest differentiation option. Completely unique in the competitive set. But requires implementation work.

#### Option C: Space Grotesk

**Pros:**
- Modern geometric sans-serif with more character than Montserrat
- The slightly quirky letterforms (look at the lowercase "a" and "g") give it personality without sacrificing readability
- Feels "tech-forward" and "architectural" -- consistent with the documentation/systems positioning
- Available on Google Fonts. Free.

**Cons:**
- Still a sans-serif. Less differentiation than a serif would provide.
- The quirky letterforms that give it character can also feel "startup-y" at certain sizes
- Not dramatically different from Montserrat at body sizes -- the upgrade is most noticeable at display sizes

**How it would feel in context:**

```
Space Grotesk at H1:
"One vendor. Four seasons. Zero liability gaps."
-- Feels modern, clean, slightly more distinctive than Montserrat. But not dramatically different.

Space Grotesk at H2:
"Your property managed. Your liability documented."
-- Clean and professional. Slightly more personality than Montserrat but still in the same family.
```

**Verdict:** A lateral upgrade. Better than Montserrat but not a category-breaking change.

#### Option D: Fraunces (Not in Original List -- Adding as a Contender)

**Pros:**
- A variable serif with a warm, slightly organic character
- "Soft serif" feel that avoids the stiffness of traditional serifs
- Optical size axis means it looks right at both large display and smaller heading sizes
- Pairs beautifully with geometric sans-serifs like Open Sans
- Available on Google Fonts. Free.

**Cons:**
- Less "sharp" than DM Serif Display -- may lean too warm/friendly for B2B commercial
- More decorative than necessary for this brand's voice
- Less name recognition if that matters for development discussions

**Verdict:** Interesting but leans too soft. DM Serif Display is the better choice for this brand's "sharp > warm" voice hierarchy.

### Recommendation: Switch to DM Serif Display for Headlines

**The reasoning:**

1. **Zero competitors use serif fonts.** This is a category-first move. When every landscaping website uses Open Sans, Source Sans Pro, DM Sans, or Museo Sans, a serif headline font immediately signals "this is not like the others." This is the same principle that makes the Slate + Ochre palette work -- it breaks the category default.

2. **DM Serif Display matches the brand voice.** The font has confidence without being flashy. It reads "established" without needing to be old. It pairs naturally with the editorial letter-spacing already in the CSS (-0.03em on H1, -0.02em on H2).

3. **The effort is manageable.** The change requires:
   - Adding DM Serif Display to the Google Fonts import
   - Updating the `--font-heading` variable in `globals.css`
   - Testing all headings at each breakpoint for wrapping/sizing issues
   - Adjusting letter-spacing values if needed (serif fonts often need slightly less negative tracking than sans-serifs)
   - Estimated effort: 2-4 hours for a developer, including testing

4. **Do NOT change the body font.** Open Sans stays. It is readable, professional, and well-implemented. The change is headlines only.

5. **If the switch creates problems, revert is trivial.** Because the font is controlled by a CSS variable, reverting to Montserrat takes one line of code.

**Implementation notes for the font switch:**

```css
/* In globals.css -- change this: */
--font-heading: var(--font-montserrat), system-ui, sans-serif;

/* To this: */
--font-heading: var(--font-dm-serif-display), Georgia, serif;
```

```
/* In the Next.js font configuration, add: */
import { DM_Serif_Display } from 'next/font/google'

const dmSerifDisplay = DM_Serif_Display({
  weight: '400',
  subsets: ['latin'],
  variable: '--font-dm-serif-display',
})
```

**Letter-spacing adjustment (may be needed):**
- H1: change from `-0.03em` to `-0.02em` (serif fonts generally need less tight tracking)
- H2: change from `-0.02em` to `-0.01em`
- H3: change from `-0.01em` to `0` or leave as-is

**Decision point:** If the development bandwidth does not exist to test the font change before launch, keep Montserrat and revisit post-launch. A font change is a "nice to have" that compounds over time but does not block revenue. Photography and the new-company narrative are higher priorities.

## 4. Refined Messaging Matrix

### Updated "We Say / We Never Say" List

This builds on the original brand copy audit and incorporates findings from the competitive audit and deep research.

#### WE SAY (Sharpened for Competitive Advantage)

| Phrase | Why It Works | Where to Use |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **"One vendor. Four seasons. Zero liability gaps."** | Validated by the competitive audit as stronger than every competitor headline. No one else names the liability angle. | Hero headline, email subject lines, proposal headers |
| **"Documented service for every visit"** | Zero competitors lead with documentation. This is the single most differentiated verbal message in the market. | Trust bar, WhyUs section, snow page, proposals, emails |
| **"28 visits or 32? We'll show you the difference."** | NEW. From pricing validation research: visit count is how property managers actually compare bids. No competitor makes this transparent. | Commercial grounds page, proposals, sales conversations |
| **"Your property named as additional insured"** | Specific, technical, and exactly what commercial buyers need to hear. No competitor publishes insurance specifics. | Trust bar, commercial grounds page, proposals |
| **"Owner-operated. Not for sale."** | NEW. Positions against PE consolidation without naming competitors. "Not for sale" is a structural statement. | About page, email outreach, proposals |
| **"You deal with a decision-maker, not a dispatcher"** | Validated as unique in the competitive set. Directly attacks the BrightView/Schill weakness. | WhyUs section, About page, email sequence |
| **"Your budget stays predictable"** | Budget predictability is the #2 buying trigger. "Stays predictable" is ongoing language, not a one-time promise. | Hero subheadline, commercial grounds page, proposals |
| **"Cleared before your employees arrive"** | Snow-specific. Outcome-focused. No competitor frames snow removal as an employee-experience outcome. | Snow page hero, snow contract details, email outreach |
| **"When a tenant reports a slip-and-fall, your records are ready"** | Frames documentation as legal protection. Property managers think about this constantly. Nobody else says it. | Snow page, commercial grounds page, proposals |
| **"Not a call center. Not a voicemail tree."** | Validated: no competitor uses anti-corporate language this direct. | About page, owner quote, email signature |
| **"We built this company from a blank page"** | NEW. New-company narrative. Turns "no history" into "no legacy problems." | About page, proposals, sales conversations |
| **"Pre-defined escalation caps for multi-year agreements"** | NEW. From pricing research. Signals contractual sophistication that incumbents rarely offer proactively. | Commercial grounds page, proposals |
| **"Same crew. Same standards. Every visit."** | Consistency messaging that no competitor claims with this specificity. | WhyUs section, commercial grounds page |

#### WE NEVER SAY

| Phrase | Why It Hurts | What We Say Instead |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **"Beautiful landscapes"** | Residential aesthetic language. Every competitor says it. Means nothing. | "Professionally maintained grounds" |
| **"Full-service"** | Appears on 7 of 10 competitor sites. Completely generic. | "Year-round under a single contract" |
| **"Commitment to excellence"** | Corporate cliche. Zero proof mechanism. | Specific commitments: "4-hour response," "GPS-documented" |
| **"Customized solutions"** | Vague. Every competitor says "tailored to your needs." | "28-visit or 32-visit plans with transparent scope" |
| **"Years of experience"** | We don't have them. And when competitors say it, it means nothing without specifics. | "Purpose-built systems" or specific proof points |
| **"Trusted partner"** | Generic. Says nothing about how trust is earned. | "Trusted by Mike's Carwash" (named proof) |
| **"Peace of mind"** | Consumer language. Property managers don't talk this way. | "Documented compliance" or "liability protection" |
| **"One-stop shop"** | Folksy. Sounds residential. Wimberg uses it. | "Single-contract year-round management" |
| **"Curb appeal"** | Residential real estate language. | "Property condition" or "tenant satisfaction" |
| **"We take care of your grounds so you can focus on your business"** | The #1 industry cliche. At least 4 competitors use a version of this. | Flip it: "You verify our work through documented service logs. Trust, but verify." |
| **"[Competitor name]"** | Never name a competitor in outbound marketing. Let the structural argument stand. | "National chains," "investment-backed operators," "your current vendor" |
| **"Free estimate"** | Commodity language. Signals "we are comparing prices." | "No-obligation site assessment" |
| **"Affordable"** | Price-sensitive positioning. Attracts the wrong buyer. | "Predictable," "fixed annual pricing," "budget-aligned" |
| **"We're hiring!"** | Signals understaffed, not growing. | Discuss hiring through professional channels, not customer-facing copy. |

### Contract Clarity Messaging (28 vs. 32 Visits)

This is the single biggest verbal differentiation opportunity surfaced by the deep research that is not yet on the website. The pricing validation research found:

> "Ohio's landscape maintenance season is typically about 38-40 weeks, and annual contracts commonly differ materially based on whether the plan is closer to 28 visits vs. 32 visits."

**Why this matters:** When property managers compare bids, the lowest number often wins. But the lowest number frequently hides scope reduction. A 28-visit contract at $18,000 looks cheaper than a 32-visit contract at $22,000 -- until October, when the 28-visit vendor has "completed" their season and the leaves are still falling.

**How to use this:**

#### Commercial Grounds Page -- Tier Descriptions (Updated)

```
STANDARD MAINTENANCE              PREMIUM MAINTENANCE
28 visits | April-October          32 visits | March-November

Weekly mowing (28 weeks)           Weekly mowing (32 weeks)
Seasonal cleanup (2x)              Seasonal cleanup (4x)
Basic bed maintenance              Full bed maintenance
Snow removal included              Snow removal included
                                   Monthly property report
                                   Priority storm response

$12,000-25,000/year               $25,000-45,000/year

ENTERPRISE MAINTENANCE
36+ visits | Year-round

Continuous site maintenance
Full bed and tree care
Snow removal + pre-treatment

Quarterly site review with ownership

$45,000-60,000/year

All tiers include: $2M liability coverage, GPS-documented service,
4-hour response guarantee, direct owner access, your property named
as additional insured.
```

#### Proposal Language

```
This proposal includes [28/32/36] scheduled maintenance visits between
[start date] and [end date]. The following services are included in
each visit: [specific list]. The following services are NOT included
and are quoted separately if needed: [specific exclusions].

Unlike many competitive bids, this scope document shows you exactly
what you are buying, how often, and what is not covered. We believe
contract clarity prevents the mid-season disputes that damage vendor
relationships.
```

#### Sales Conversation Script

> "When you compare our proposal to another bid, look at three things: visit count, season length, and what's excluded. A lot of bids look lower because they're quoting 28 visits when you need 32, or they end the season in October when your leaves don't stop falling until November. We structure our proposals to show you exactly what's included so there are no surprises in September."

### Updated Value Propositions by Audience Segment

#### Property Managers (Multi-Site, Commercial Real Estate)

| Priority | Value Proposition | Proof Point | Lead Copy |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Documented service for liability protection | GPS logs, timestamps, photos | "Every visit documented. When a tenant files a claim, your records are ready." |
| 2 | Vendor consolidation eliminates coordination overhead | Single contract, single invoice | "One vendor. Four seasons. No gaps between seasonal contractors." |
| 3 | Budget predictability across all seasons | Fixed annual pricing, no surprise invoices | "You know what grounds management costs in January and July." |
| 4 | Owner accountability vs. corporate chain | Direct decision-maker access | "When you call, a person who can solve the problem picks up." |
| 5 | PE consolidation insurance | Owner-operated, not for sale | "We are not answering to an investment committee. We answer to you." |

#### Facilities Directors (Corporate Campuses, Medical)

## 5. Updated Email Outreach Sequence

### Refinements from Deep Research

The original 3-email sequence from the brand audit is solid. These refinements incorporate:
- The PE consolidation angle (structural argument, no names)
- Contract clarity differentiation (28 vs. 32 visits)
- Specific pain points from the customer acquisition research (vendor coordination, documentation, budget)
- Integration with the 20 named target companies from the deep research
- An Email 4 follow-up
- A separate HOA-specific sequence

### Property Manager Sequence (Revised, 4 Emails)

**Target:** Property managers and facilities directors at commercial real estate firms, PM companies, and corporate facilities in Blue Ash, West Chester, Mason, Liberty Township, and surrounding corridors.

**Volume:** 50 property management companies from the deep research target list (Towne Properties, Neyer Management, Anchor Associates, Phillips Edison, Colliers, Avison Young, Steiner + Associates, Henkle Schueler, Merus, CMC Properties, Westheimer Real Estate, Midland Retail, Clous Road Partners, Sansone Group, and others).

**Sending via:** Instantly.ai

#### Email 1: Pain Point + Consolidation Angle

**Subject Line A:** Managing 3 vendors for one property?

**Subject Line B:** Your vendor just got acquired. Now what?

**From:** {{senderName}}, Stone & Salt

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

I manage grounds for commercial properties in the {{city}} area, and I keep hearing the same frustration from property managers:

Three vendors. Three invoices. Three people who blame each other when something falls through the cracks.

Your mowing crew wraps up in November. Your snow contractor takes over in December. In between? Nobody owns it. And when a tenant calls about an icy sidewalk at 6 AM, you are the one making calls and hoping someone picks up.

Meanwhile, the commercial landscape industry in Cincinnati is consolidating fast. Regional operators are getting bought by investment firms. Account managers are getting replaced. If your current vendor feels more corporate lately, there is a reason.

Stone & Salt handles grounds maintenance and snow removal under a single year-round contract -- one team, one point of contact, documented service for every visit. We are owner-operated and built specifically to solve this problem.

If you are evaluating vendors for the spring season, I would be happy to share how we structure year-round agreements for properties like yours.

Best,
{{senderName}}

**What changed from v1:** Added the PE consolidation angle (paragraph 3) without naming any competitor. Subject Line B is the more aggressive option -- use it for the second batch if Subject Line A underperforms. Added "Owner-Operated" to the signature line to reinforce the positioning.

---

#### Email 2: Solution + Proof + Contract Clarity

**Subject Line:** How Mike's Carwash solved the vendor coordination problem

**From:** {{senderName}}, Stone & Salt

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick follow-up on my last note about managing property vendors.

We recently partnered with Mike's Carwash for year-round grounds management -- mowing, seasonal maintenance, and snow removal under a single contract. One invoice. One phone call when they need something.

Here is what changed for them:
- No more coordinating handoffs between seasonal contractors
- Every service visit documented with GPS timestamps and photos
- A fixed annual budget instead of per-event billing surprises
- Direct access to an owner when something needs attention

One thing we do differently: our proposals break down exactly how many visits you are getting, what is included in each, and what is not. Most bids in this market show a number but hide the scope. We show you 28 visits vs. 32 visits and what that means for your property in October when the leaves are still falling and the 28-visit vendor's season has "ended."

If you manage properties in the {{city}} area and are open to a 15-minute call, I would like to understand your current setup and see if our model is a fit.

No pressure either way.

{{senderName}}

**What changed from v1:** Added the contract clarity paragraph (28 vs. 32 visits). This is the verbal whitespace no competitor occupies. It also plants the seed that Stone & Salt's proposals will be more transparent than what they are used to seeing.

---

#### Email 3: Urgency + Direct Ask

**Subject Line:** Spring capacity closing -- {{city}} area

**From:** {{senderName}}, Stone & Salt

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Last note from me on this.

We are finalizing our spring commercial routes and have capacity for 2-3 more properties in the {{city}} corridor. Once those spots fill, we will not be able to take on new grounds contracts until we expand crew capacity later this year.

If you have been considering a change in grounds management -- or if your current vendor's spring performance gives you pause -- this is the window.

Here is what I am offering: a no-obligation site assessment of your property. I will walk the grounds, identify what your current service is missing, and put together a proposal with fixed annual pricing. You will see exactly how many visits, what is included, and what is excluded. Takes about 30 minutes on-site and costs you nothing.

If you want to schedule this week or next, reply to this email or call me directly at {{phone}}.

If the timing is not right, no hard feelings. I will check back in Q4 when you are planning next year's budget.

**What changed from v1:** Added the contract transparency language to the site assessment offer ("you will see exactly how many visits, what is included, and what is excluded"). Minor refinement -- the original Email 3 was already strong.

---

#### Email 4: The Q4 Budget Season Follow-Up (NEW)

**Timing:** Send in September-October to contacts who did not convert in the spring sequence.

**Subject Line A:** Planning your 2027 grounds budget?

**Subject Line B:** Before you renew with your current vendor

**From:** {{senderName}}, Stone & Salt

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

I reached out earlier this year about year-round grounds management. At the time, the timing was not right -- and I said I would follow up when you were planning next year's budget.

So here I am.

If you are renewing your current vendor for 2027, you are probably seeing a price increase. Input costs have risen -- Ohio's minimum wage went up, salt prices are up ~7% year-over-year, and the wage ladder has compressed across the industry. That is the reality.

What you should not accept is a price increase without a scope increase. If your vendor is charging more but still delivering the same 28-visit plan with the same exclusions, you deserve to see what a purpose-built alternative looks like.

I would like to walk your property and put together a competing proposal. No obligation. You will see exactly what is included, how many visits, and what is excluded -- so you can compare it apples-to-apples against your renewal.

If October is your budget window, let me get on your calendar this month.

**Why this works:**
- Times perfectly to the Q4 budget cycle identified in the customer acquisition research
- Acknowledges the earlier outreach without being pushy ("I said I would follow up")
- Uses real data points (Ohio minimum wage increase, salt price trends) to frame the competitive bid as timely
- The "price increase without a scope increase" angle directly leverages the 28 vs. 32 visit differentiation
- Low-friction ask: just a walkthrough and a competing proposal

### Email Sequence Summary (Property Manager, 4 Emails)

| Email | Timing | Goal | Key Angle | CTA |
|-------|--------|------|-----------|-----|
| 1: Pain + Consolidation | Day 0 (Feb-Mar) | Establish relevance, plant consolidation seed | Vendor fragmentation + industry consolidation | Soft: "happy to share" |
| 2: Proof + Clarity | Day 3-4 | Demonstrate solution, introduce contract transparency | Mike's Carwash + 28 vs. 32 visits | Medium: 15-min call |
| 3: Urgency | Day 8-11 | Create deadline, direct ask for site assessment | Capacity scarcity + transparent proposal | Hard: Schedule this week |
| 4: Budget Season | September-October | Re-engage non-converters during budget planning | Price increase framing + competing proposal | Hard: Get on calendar this month |

---

### HOA-Specific Outreach Sequence (NEW)

**Why a separate sequence:** The customer acquisition research identifies a fundamentally different buying cycle for HOAs:
- Landscape contracts are bid out every 3-5 years (not annually)
- The board is the legal decision-maker but the management company runs the vendor process
- The best entry strategy is becoming an auxiliary vendor first (enhancements, snow, storm cleanup) to position for the full contract at the next cycle
- HOA managers respond to budget certainty and resident complaint reduction

**Target:** HOA/COA management companies from the deep research target list (Associa Real Property Management, Management Plus Realty Services, Eclipse Community Management, Stonegate Property Management, Advantage Property Management, Lebanon Association Management).

---

#### HOA Email 1: Vendor Registration + Auxiliary Entry

**Subject Line:** Getting on your approved vendor list

**From:** {{senderName}}, Stone & Salt

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

I manage grounds and snow operations for commercial properties in the {{city}} area, and I would like to get Stone & Salt on your approved vendor list for the communities you manage.

I know most landscape maintenance contracts are on multi-year cycles and may not be up for bid anytime soon. That is fine.

What I am asking for is simpler: consider us for auxiliary work -- seasonal enhancements, storm cleanup, snow response, or irrigation repairs. The kind of work that does not require breaking an existing contract but lets you evaluate us under real conditions.

If we deliver, we would like to be considered when contracts do come up for renewal.

We carry $2M in general liability (with your community named as additional insured), GPS-document every service visit, and can provide a fixed scope and price for any project.

What is the best way to submit our credentials and get on file?

{{senderName}}
Stone & Salt | Year-Round Grounds Management
Owner-Operated | Greater Cincinnati
{{phone}}

---

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges the HOA bid cycle directly ("multi-year cycles... may not be up for bid anytime soon"). This signals you understand how their world works.
- Asks for the lowest-friction entry point: auxiliary vendor status
- "If we deliver, we'd like to be considered" positions the long game without being presumptuous
- Insurance and documentation specifics are table stakes for HOA vendor approval

---

#### HOA Email 2: Snow as the Entry Point

**Subject Line:** Snow vendor backup for your communities

**From:** {{senderName}}, Stone & Salt

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Following up on my note about getting on your vendor list.

One area where communities often need backup is snow and ice. If your current landscape vendor handles snow but their capacity gets stretched during major events, or if your communities use a separate snow contractor, we can fill that gap.

Here is what we provide:
- Seasonal snow contracts with fixed pricing (your board approves it once)
- GPS-documented service with timestamps and photos for every visit
- $2M liability coverage -- critical for sidewalk slip-and-fall protection
- Plowing triggered at 2-inch accumulation, sidewalks cleared before residents leave for work

For communities that want to evaluate us before committing to a full grounds contract, snow is a clean way to see how we operate under pressure.

Would it help if I sent over a capabilities summary you can share with your boards?

#### HOA Email 3: Budget Framing for Board Approval

**Subject Line:** Fixed pricing your board can approve in one meeting

**From:** {{senderName}}, Stone & Salt

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Last note from me for now.

I know that getting a new vendor approved through a board is a process. Boards want fixed numbers, clear scope, and no surprises. That is exactly how we structure our proposals.

When we quote a community, the board sees:
- A fixed annual price (same every month, January through December)
- Exactly how many visits per season (28, 32, or 36+)
- What is included in every visit and what is billed separately
- Pre-defined escalation caps if the contract extends to a second or third year

No hidden fees. No mid-season renegotiation. No "we need to talk about a change order."

If any of your communities are approaching contract renewal in the next 6-12 months and would benefit from a competing proposal, I would like to walk the property and put something together.

Either way, I appreciate your time. If you would like us on file for future reference, I am happy to send a one-page capabilities sheet.

### HOA Sequence Summary

| Email | Timing | Goal | Key Angle | CTA |
|-------|--------|------|-----------|-----|
| 1: Vendor Registration | Day 0 | Get on approved vendor list, signal long-game awareness | Auxiliary work as entry | Soft: "What's the best way to submit credentials?" |
| 2: Snow Entry | Day 5-7 | Position snow as a low-risk evaluation opportunity | Snow backup, GPS documentation | Medium: "Send capabilities summary?" |
| 3: Budget Framing | Day 12-14 | Frame proposal structure for board approval | Fixed pricing, visit counts, escalation caps | Hard: "Walk the property for a competing proposal" |

**Expected dynamics:** HOA sequences convert slower (months, not weeks) but produce higher-value, longer-duration contracts. The 3-5 year bid cycle means the first outreach plants a seed that may not bloom until 2027 or 2028. The auxiliary vendor strategy (snow, enhancements) creates a relationship and a track record that compounds.

## 6. Brand Guard Rails

### What Makes Stone & Salt's Brand Work (Protect These)

These are the elements the competitive audit validated as in whitespace. They are the brand's structural advantages. Any decision that weakens them should be rejected.

#### 1. The Color Palette

Eucalyptus + Sun-Ochre + Slate + Soft Cream is the single biggest visual differentiator. The audit confirmed: zero competitors use warm tones. Zero competitors use slate as a primary. The eucalyptus reads "nature" without screaming "lawn company."

**Guard rail:** Never add bright green, lime green, or saturated grass green to the palette. Never switch the background from warm cream to pure white. Never remove the Sun-Ochre accent. These changes would move Stone & Salt toward the industry default.

#### 2. The "Boots Not Brochure" Voice Filter

This is the editorial discipline that produces every line of copy. The test: "Would a property manager who has been burned by BrightView believe this?" If the answer is no, the line does not ship.

**Guard rail:** Never use superlatives without proof mechanisms. Never promise without specifying the mechanism. "Reliable" is banned without saying how (4-hour response, GPS documentation, owner access). "Quality" is banned without showing what (named client, specific standard, documented process).

#### 3. The Documentation-First Messaging

No competitor leads with documentation as a value proposition. This is the most differentiated verbal message in the market. It addresses the #1 property manager fear (liability) and the #1 decision factor (risk reduction).

**Guard rail:** Documentation must remain in the hero trust bar, the WhyUs section, and the first paragraph of every service page. It cannot be demoted to a secondary message. The moment documentation becomes a bullet point instead of a headline, the brand loses its most unique angle.

#### 4. The Specific Trust Signals

"$2M Liability Coverage. Documented Service Logs. 4-Hour Response Guarantee. Trusted by Mike's Carwash." Every element is specific. Every competitor uses generic signals ("Licensed & Insured," "Quality Service," "Experienced Team").

**Guard rail:** Never replace specific trust signals with generic ones. If a trust signal changes (e.g., insurance amount increases, response time improves), update the specific number. Never round up or use vague language. "$2M" is better than "fully insured." "4-hour" is better than "fast response."

#### 5. The Commercial-First Hierarchy

Commercial Grounds > Snow & Ice > Hardscapes > Residential. This is the service hierarchy across navigation, page weight, CTA prominence, and outreach priority.

**Guard rail:** Never give residential equal visual weight to commercial on the homepage. Never lead with hardscapes. Never position snow as an afterthought. The residential section should always communicate "available when commercial capacity allows" -- scarcity, not enthusiasm.

#### 6. The CTA Language

"Request Site Assessment" (not "Get a Quote"). "See Our Commercial Services" (not "Contact Us"). "Schedule Property Walkthrough" (not "Free Estimate").

**Guard rail:** Never revert to "Get a Quote" or "Contact Us." These are commodity signals. The professional language matches how property managers actually engage vendors and signals that Stone & Salt operates at the commercial level.

### What to Never Do (Based on What Competitors Do Wrong)

#### 1. Never Use Stock Photography of People

BrightView, U.S. Lawns, and Wimberg use photography that looks stock-adjacent even when it is real, because it follows the same bright-green-lawn template. The moment Stone & Salt uses a stock photo of a smiling worker in a polo shirt, the "boots not brochure" voice becomes a lie.

**Rule:** If real photos of Stone & Salt crews and properties are not available, use design-heavy imagery (gradients, texture, typography) instead. A well-designed graphic is honest. A stock photo is a costume.

#### 2. Never Lead with Years in Business

The new-company narrative works because it is honest and forward-looking. The moment Stone & Salt has 3, 5, or 10 years under its belt, there will be temptation to start leading with "serving Cincinnati for X years." Resist it.

**Rule:** Lead with systems, proof points, and named clients. Years in business is a secondary supporting detail, not a headline. The brand's identity is "purpose-built," not "we have been around a while."

#### 3. Never Make Promises Without Mechanisms

BrightView promises "consistently excellent results." Schill promises "stress-free" service. Wimberg promises "it's guaranteed to grow." None of these promises have proof mechanisms attached.

**Rule:** Every promise on the Stone & Salt website must have an attached proof mechanism. "4-hour response" is a promise with a mechanism (a written guarantee). "Documented service" is a promise with a mechanism (GPS logs, timestamps, photos). "Reliable" without a mechanism is banned.

#### 4. Never Adopt the Green-on-White Template

The entire commercial landscaping industry uses green as a primary color on white backgrounds. Engledow is the sole exception (navy blue). Stone & Salt's palette is a structural brand asset.

**Rule:** If a designer, marketer, or partner suggests "we should look more like a landscaping company," the answer is no. The entire point of the visual identity is that it does NOT look like a landscaping company. It looks like a premium service firm that happens to manage grounds.

#### 5. Never Compete on Price

The brand is positioned on documentation, accountability, and predictability -- not on being the cheapest option. Competing on price would collapse the entire positioning strategy.

**Rule:** If a prospect says "your competitor bid $X less," the response is: "Let me show you the scope comparison. How many visits are they quoting? What's excluded? Is documentation included? Are you named as additional insured?" Price objections are scope-transparency opportunities.

#### 6. Never Use Passive CTAs

"Contact Us," "Learn More," "Submit" are passive. Every competitor uses them. Stone & Salt's CTAs are active and specific.

**Rule:** Every CTA must describe what happens next. "Request Site Assessment" tells the user what they are getting. "Get Seasonal Contract Details" tells them what they will receive. "Contact Us" tells them nothing.

#### 7. Never Lose the Owner-Accessible Angle as the Company Grows

In Year 1, "you deal directly with an owner" is natural. In Year 3, with 20+ contracts and multiple crews, the temptation will be to hire account managers and reduce owner involvement.

**Rule:** Maintain owner touchpoints at critical moments even as the company scales: contract signing, annual review, any service failure. The owner does not need to answer every phone call at scale, but the owner must be present for high-stakes conversations. The messaging can evolve from "you get my cell" to "ownership is involved at every contract milestone" -- but the structural advantage of owner accountability must remain real, not theoretical.

### Consistency Rules as the Company Grows

1. **Any new marketing material (proposal, social post, mailer) must be checked against the "We Say / We Never Say" list.** Especially watch for residential language ("beautiful," "dream," "curb appeal") creeping into commercial materials.

2. **Any photography must follow the creative brief's rules.** Atmospheric lighting, documentary style, human faces with names, seasonal variety. If a photographer proposes bright-midday shots of perfect lawns, redirect them.

3. **Any website copy changes must maintain the specific-over-generic principle.** If someone suggests replacing "$2M Liability Coverage" with "Fully Insured" for simplicity, reject it.

4. **The "boots not brochure" filter applies to every channel.** Emails, social media, proposals, in-person conversations. If it sounds like a brochure, rewrite it.

5. **Revisit this document quarterly.** The competitive landscape will change (more acquisitions, new entrants, pricing shifts). The brand guard rails should evolve as the company's position strengthens, but the core principles -- documentation-first, specific-over-generic, commercial-primary, owner-accountable -- should hold for the first 3-5 years.

# Stone & Salt -- Business Plan Synthesis
## Lead Synthesis Agent | February 15, 2026

## 1. Executive Summary

**Stone & Salt** is a commercial-primary year-round grounds management company targeting Greater Cincinnati's northern suburbs (Liberty Township, West Chester, Mason, Blue Ash, Loveland, Indian Hill). Two equal owner-operators eliminate the vendor fragmentation problem for commercial property managers by delivering grounds maintenance, snow and ice management, estate mowing, and hardscaping under one contract, one phone number, and one accountable relationship.

**The market:** The Greater Cincinnati commercial grounds and snow management market is estimated at $500-700M serviceable. PE consolidation is accelerating (Schill/TruArc January 2026, GroundsPRO/Visterra 2024), creating churn and dissatisfaction among property managers who are losing their personal vendor relationships. No local competitor leads with documentation, owner accessibility, and year-round single-vendor accountability as a primary message.

**The financials:** Year 1 revenue is projected at $285,000-$325,000 from 6-8 commercial grounds contracts, 4-6 snow contracts, 10-15 estate mowing clients, 2-3 hardscape projects, and 10-12 residential maintenance accounts. Startup capital required is $52,000-$62,000 (recommended). Monthly break-even occurs in Month 4 (June). Cumulative break-even occurs in Month 12 (February Year 2). Partner income is approximately $37,500 each in Year 1 -- survivable, not comfortable. Year 1 is a capital deployment year, not a profit year.

**The risk:** The single largest risk is a slow commercial ramp. If only 4 contracts close instead of 8, the business ends Year 1 approximately $28,000 in the hole. If the commercial pipeline AND hardscape projects AND salt costs all go wrong simultaneously, the deficit reaches $72,000 and kills the business. Kill criteria are defined: zero new commercial contracts by Month 6 triggers a pivot away from commercial-primary.

**The verdict:** CONDITIONAL GO. The market is real, the positioning is validated, the brand is differentiated, the unit economics are strong, and the operating plan is executable. The conditions are: (1) $52,000-$62,000 startup capital is available, (2) LLC and $2M GL insurance are secured by March 1, (3) commercial outreach begins immediately, and (4) the operating agreement includes buyout provisions. If those conditions are met, launch.

## 2. Market & Competitive Position

### Market Size and Opportunity

- **Total addressable market (Cincinnati metro):** $500-700M in commercial grounds and snow management services
- **Serviceable corridor:** Northern suburbs -- Liberty Township, West Chester, Mason, Blue Ash, Loveland, Indian Hill
- **Primary customer:** Commercial property managers (35-55, managing 3-10 properties, risk-averse, budget-focused, frustrated by vendor unreliability)
- **5-Year LTV per commercial client:** $95,000-$375,000

### Competitive Landscape

**10 competitors audited.** The market breaks into four tiers:

| Tier | Competitors | Size | Stone & Salt Positioning Against |
|------|------------|------|----------------------------------|
| **National/PE-backed** | BrightView ($2.7B), Schill/TruArc ($50M+), GroundsPRO/Visterra, U.S. Lawns (franchise) | $10M-$2.7B | "When your vendor gets acquired by private equity, you become an account number, not a property." Owner-operated counter-position. |
| **Regional established** | Wimberg (4.4 stars, 60+ employees), Engledow (since 1932), Yellowstone (since 2008) | $5M-$20M | Accountability gap -- Wimberg's east-side focus limits north-suburb overlap. Engledow and Yellowstone are established but not locally dominant in the target corridor. |
| **Local operators** | GroundSystems, Werbrich's (residential-focused), various "guy with a truck" | $500K-$5M | Quality and documentation gap. None lead with GPS-documented service, timestamped logs, or guaranteed response times. |
| **Stone & Salt** | New entrant, owner-operated, year-round single vendor | Startup | Differentiated on 8 of 12 brand dimensions. Whitespace: warm color palette, documentation-first messaging, owner-cell-number accessibility, "boots not brochure" voice. |

### Brand Whitespace

The competitive audit confirms Stone & Salt is differentiated on 8 of 12 dimensions:

1. **Color palette** -- Slate + Eucalyptus + Sun-Ochre is completely unique in a green-dominated industry (zero competitors use warm accents)
2. **Brand voice** -- "Boots not brochure" is the only conversational-sharp voice in the market; competitors are either corporate-generic or folksy
3. **Documentation-first messaging** -- No competitor leads with service documentation as a brand promise
4. **Owner accessibility** -- "You get my cell" is a positioning claim no scaled competitor can make
5. **Year-round single-vendor framing** -- While others offer both services, none make "zero coverage gaps" the headline
6. **PE consolidation counter-narrative** -- "Built to fix what the 40-year incumbents still get wrong"
7. **CTA language** -- "Request Site Assessment" vs. generic "Contact Us" signals commercial sophistication
8. **Response guarantee** -- 4-hour response time commitment is not claimed by any audited competitor

### Gaps in Competitive Position

- **No track record:** This is the single biggest trust barrier. Counter-position ("purpose-built, not inherited") addresses it directionally, but only real client references and time will fully close this gap.
- **No real photography:** All branded placeholder images. First job photos are critical for credibility.
- **Mike's Carwash reference missing from website:** The brand audit called for "Trusted by Mike's Carwash" in the hero trust bar. It was not implemented. This is the only existing client reference and it needs to be added (with permission).

## 3. Service Lines & Pricing

### Revenue Model (Validated Pricing from PRICING_BENCHMARKS.md + Deep Research)

| Service Line | Pricing Model | Range | Year 1 Target | % of Revenue | Gross Margin |
|-------------|---------------|-------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Commercial grounds maintenance** | Monthly retainer (annual contract) | $12,000-$60,000/year | $91,500 | 32% | 49-59% |
| **Commercial snow removal** | Fixed seasonal | $5,000-$25,000/season | $71,100 | 25% | 51-55% |
| **Estate mowing** | Seasonal (28 visits) | $3,000-$5,000/season | $26,000 | 9% | 36-44% |
| **Residential hardscape** | Project-based (50% deposit) | $25,000+ minimum | $60,000 | 21% | 37% |
| **Residential maintenance** | Monthly | $300-$600/month | $36,400 | 13% | 20% |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$285,000-$325,000** | **100%** | **~52% blended** |

**Pricing validation:** Deep research confirms $12K-$60K annual commercial grounds range is "well-calibrated" and "consistent with per-acre benchmarks." Snow seasonal contracts of $5K-$25K are "strongly supported by Cincinnati-specific pricing guidance." Per-event snow at $350-$1,500+ validated.

### Key Pricing Decisions

1. **Salt baseline corrected to $96.40/ton** (Butler County Engineer's Office procurement, May 2025). The CONCEPT-BRIEF used $67/ton (DOT rate). The financial model v2 uses $96.40 as the planning baseline.
2. **Salt surcharge clause is non-negotiable.** Every snow contract must include: "Material costs based on $100/ton bulk rate. Actual costs exceeding $100/ton will be passed through at cost plus 10% handling." Without this clause, a $175/ton spike costs $6,000-$8,000 in lost profit. With it, heavy winters become net positive.
3. **Visit-count transparency recommended.** Deep research identifies explicit 28-visit vs. 32-visit tier structuring as the primary way property managers compare bids. Current tier descriptions (Standard/Premium/Enterprise) focus on features but not visit counts. This should be added to proposals and website.
4. **Multi-year agreement caps recommended.** Pre-defined annual escalation caps (e.g., 3-5% annually) for multi-year contracts signal sophistication and protect margins.

### Unit Economics Summary

| Service | Avg Contract/Project Value | Total Cost | Gross Profit | Margin |
|---------|--------------------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Commercial grounds (per contract) | $18,000/year | $7,410-$9,170 | $8,830-$10,590 | 49-59% |
| Commercial snow (per contract) | $12,000/season | $5,357 | $6,643 | 55% |
| Estate mowing (per client) | $3,500/season | $1,945-$2,225 | $1,275-$1,555 | 36-44% |
| Hardscape (per project) | $30,000 | $18,900 | $11,100 | 37% |
| Residential maintenance (per account) | $3,150/year | $2,520 | $630 | 20% |

**Margin compression is expected.** Year 1 margins are high because partners are doing the work. As crews are hired (Month 5+), margins compress toward industry norms. Year 1 blended gross margin: ~59%. Year 2: ~48-52%. Year 3: ~42-48%. Absolute dollars grow even as percentages shrink.

24 specific action items identified, ordered by dependency. The 4 blocking actions:

1. Get a real 513 business phone number (blocks everything)
2. Form the LLC ($99 online filing, same-day EIN)
3. Secure $2M GL insurance (blocks every commercial proposal)
4. Update all phone numbers on the website

**Total pre-launch cash needed by March 1: ~$17,098** (includes first insurance quarter, hand equipment, trailer, signage, spreader, memberships)

### Target Companies (20 Named)

The deep research identified 20 specific companies organized into 3 tiers:

| Tier | Companies | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **A -- High Priority (7)** | Towne Properties, Anchor Associates, Steiner + Associates, Phillips Edison, Stonegate PM, Associa, Management Plus | Multi-property portfolios, active vendor cycles, physical presence in target corridor |
| **B -- Strong (7)** | Neyer Management, CBRE (local), JLL (local), Cushman & Wakefield (local), Brandstetter Carroll, Messer (facilities), Vandercar Holdings | Larger portfolios or corporate campuses; longer sales cycles but higher contract values |

### Channel Strategy and Budget

**Annual marketing budget: $12,050** (3.7% of $325K target; within industry guideline of 5-10% for growth-stage companies)

| Channel | Annual Budget | When | Expected ROI |
|---------|-------------|------|-------------|
| **Cold email (Instantly.ai)** | $444 (tool) + $15 (domain) | Year-round, starting March 3 | 1-5% reply rate, 2-4% meeting-booked. Cheapest CAC channel. |
| **Cold calling** | $0 (phone through GHL) | Year-round, starting March 1 | 4.82% meeting-book rate. 175+ calls in March. |
| **Google PPC** | $4,000 | Front-loaded Mar-May ($500/mo), reduced Jun-Dec | $50/lead spring, $100 summer, $200+ winter. Bridge until LSA live. |
| **Google LSA** | $3,600 | Starting mid-March (3-4 week verification) | ~$39 avg CPL. Google Verified badge builds trust. |
| **LinkedIn** | $0 | Connection requests + InMails to 20 targets | 65% of InMail responses arrive within 24 hours. |
| **Direct mail** | $700 | 50 capability packets to PMs | 2.7-4.4% response rate. Physical touchpoint in a digital world. |
| **IFMA/IREM networking** | $500 | Monthly events starting March | Relationship-driven. Puts Stone & Salt in recurring proximity to decision-makers. |
| **Vehicle signage** | $1,200 | Installed by Feb 28 | Every mile driven is marketing. |
| **Referral incentives** | $1,000 | After first client success | $500 per signed annual contract. Highest-quality leads. |

### 90-Day Calendar (March-May 2026)

**Month 1 (March) targets:**
- 100-150 cold emails sent
- 175+ cold calls made
- 8-15 PM conversations initiated
- 3-5 site assessments scheduled
- 1-2 proposals sent
- Google PPC live; LSA application submitted (verification in progress)

**Month 2 (April) targets:**
- Continued outreach (100+ emails, 150+ calls)
- 5-10 active conversations
- 3-5 proposals out
- LSA goes live (first inbound leads)
- First new contract close (target)

**Month 3 (May) targets:**
- 2-3 commercial contracts active (including Mike's Carwash)
- 8-10 estate mowing clients
- First hardscape project deposit received
- Pipeline: 5+ active proposals for Q2-Q3 closes

### Kill Criteria for GTM

If by Month 6 (August): zero new commercial contracts beyond Mike's Carwash, cumulative revenue under $60,000, or pipeline has fewer than 2 active proposals -- **PIVOT.** Abandon commercial-primary, shift to residential hardscape + maintenance, restructure cost base downward.

## 5. Operations

### Technology Stack

| System | Role | Cost | Why This One |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **GoHighLevel (GHL)** | CRM, prospect pipeline, phone/SMS, email outreach | $0 incremental (shared with Sidekick Marketer) | Already paying. Custom pipelines, automation, 513 phone number routing. |
| **Jobber Growing** | Field service: scheduling, GPS tracking, documentation, invoicing, client portal | $59/month | GPS-timestamped visit documentation fulfills the website's core promise. Photo capture per visit. QuickBooks integration. Route optimization. |
| **QuickBooks** | Accounting, invoicing, tax prep | Already paying | Jobber syncs invoices automatically. |
| **Instantly.ai** | Cold email outreach | $37/month | Protects primary domain deliverability. Separate cold outreach domain (stoneandsalt.co). |
| **TOTAL NEW COST** | | **$96/month** | |

**Upgrade trigger:** When revenue exceeds $500,000 and crew count exceeds 5, upgrade from Jobber to Aspire ($500+/month) for job costing, multi-crew scheduling, and property management integrations.

### Prospect Pipeline (10 Stages in GHL)

1. Identified -- 2. First Contact -- 3. Conversation -- 4. Site Assessment Scheduled -- 5. Site Assessment Complete -- 6. Proposal Sent -- 7. Under Review -- 8. Negotiation -- 9. Verbal Commit -- 10. Contract Signed

Plus: Nurture (not ready now; auto-escalate in Q4 budget season) and Lost (with mandatory "why did we lose?" note).

**Key metric targets:**
- 50%+ proposal-to-contract conversion (validated by research benchmark of ~51%)
- 5+ proposals sent per month by Month 3
- Average days in pipeline tracked per stage
- Win rate tracked by lead source

### Proposal System

- **Commercial grounds:** 8-10 page proposal (property overview, scope of work with visit counts, pricing tiers, insurance documentation, service guarantee, references)
- **Snow removal:** 6-8 page proposal (trigger definitions, equipment plan, salt management approach, response time guarantees, reporting format)
- **Turnaround:** Within 48 hours of site assessment completion

### Service Documentation (Fulfills the Website Promise)

Every visit documented in Jobber with:
- GPS check-in and check-out (timestamped)
- Minimum 2 photos per visit (before/after or key areas)
- Service notes (work completed, conditions observed, issues flagged)
- Client portal access for property managers to review logs on demand

This is the system that makes "documented service logs" more than a marketing claim.

### Crew Scaling Plan

| Month | Headcount | Who | Monthly Loaded Cost |
|-------|-----------|-----|---------------------|
| 1-4 | 2 | Partners only | $0 (partner draws separate) |
| 5-6 | 3 | + 1 crew member ($20/hr) | $3,500/mo |
| 7-9 | 4 | + 2nd crew member ($20/hr) | $7,000/mo total crew |
| 10-12 | 4-5 | + seasonal snow helper ($18/hr) | $7,000-$10,500/mo |

**Hire trigger:** 5th commercial contract signed OR $20,000/month revenue sustained for 2 consecutive months.

### Q4 Budget Season Playbook (Year 2 Pipeline)

Property managers set next-year budgets in Q4. The operations system includes a September-December campaign:
- September: Re-engage all Nurture contacts with snow contract offers
- October-November: Send next-year grounds proposals to existing and prospective PMs
- December: Follow-up on all outstanding proposals before holiday freeze
- This is when Year 2's $500K-$600K pipeline gets built

---

## 6. Equipment

### Fleet Philosophy

Stone & Salt requires TWO types of mowing equipment:
- **Commercial zero-turn mowers** for flat commercial lots (3.5 acres/hour)
- **Compact tractors** for estate terrain, loader work, and snow (2.0 acres/hour)

**Critical finding from deep research:** The original concept brief assumed buying a tractor first. The equipment TCO analysis shows that using a tractor as the primary mower costs $17,000-$23,000 MORE over 5 years when operator time is valued. Buy the zero-turn first. Rent a tractor for episodic loader work.

### Day 1 Fleet (March 2026)

| Item | Cost | Method |
|------|------|--------|
| Commercial zero-turn mower (Scag Turf Tiger II 61") | $17,099 | Financed at 0% / 48 months ($356/mo) |
| Open utility trailer (16-18ft, used) | $4,000 | Cash |
| Hand equipment package (trimmers, blowers, edger, tools) | $3,500 | Cash |
| Tailgate V-box salt spreader (used) | $2,500 | Cash |
| Spare parts kit | $1,500 | Cash |
| Pickup truck #1 (with plow) | $0 | Already owned |
| Pickup truck #2 (with plow) | $0 | Already owned |
| Bobcat skid steer | $0 | Already owned |
| **Day 1 cash needed** | **$11,500** | |
| **Monthly payment** | **$356/mo** | |

**Tractor rental budget (Months 1-6):** 12 rental days at $175/day = $2,100 total for estate-specific work.

### Mid-Year Addition (Month 7-8, Trigger-Based)

**Trigger:** Estate mowing clients exceed 8 AND/OR non-mowing loader work exceeds 3 days/month for 2 consecutive months.

- **Kubota BX2380 package** (loader + 60" deck): $21,665 at 0%/36 months ($602/mo) -- Kubota promo expires 02/28/2026
- **Used alternative:** 2-3 year old JD 1025R or Kubota BX2380, under 300 hours: $15,000-$19,500
- **Decision math:** If tractor use exceeds 40 days/year, buying beats renting. Below 15 days, renting wins.

### Snow Season Setup (Month 7-8)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Bobcat pusher attachment (used) | $1,500-$3,000 |
| Sidewalk equipment (shovels, ice melt spreaders) | $500 |
| Bulk salt pre-purchase (25 tons at $96/ton) | $2,400 |
| Brine system (optional Year 1) | $1,800-$2,500 |
| **Snow season total** | **$4,400-$6,000** |

### Year 2-3 Scaling Triggers

| Trigger | Addition | Est. Cost |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Commercial contracts > 10 | 2nd commercial zero-turn | $15,000-$17,000 |
| Estate clients > 15 | 2nd tractor or L-series upgrade | $25,000-$35,000 |
| Crew count reaches 4+ | 3rd truck | $15,000-$25,000 used |
| Snow contracts > 8 | Dedicated snow truck + spreader | $20,000-$30,000 used |

## 7. Financial Summary

### Startup Capital Requirements

| Scenario | Equipment | Business Setup | Marketing | Working Capital | TOTAL |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Minimum Viable** | $11,500 | $3,034 | $2,150 | $24,000 | **$40,684** |
| **Recommended** | $11,500 | $3,034 | $2,950 | $34,500 | **$51,984** |
| **Buffer (Best)** | $11,500 | $3,034 | $2,950 | $44,500 | **$61,984** |

**Capital call timeline:** Not all $52K-$62K is needed Day 1. Day 1 requires ~$17,484. The rest deploys across Months 1-8 as the business ramps.

### Year 1 Profit & Loss

| Category | Amount | % of Revenue |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Total Revenue** | **$285,000** | 100% |
| Cost of Revenue | $116,200 | 41% |
| **Gross Profit** | **$168,800** | **59%** |
| Operating Expenses (incl. $75K partner draws) | $116,772 | 41% |
| **Net Operating Income** | **$52,028** | **18%** |
| Less: Partner draws | ($75,000) | |
| **Retained Earnings (conservative)** | **-$22,972** | |
| Plus: Misc/overflow revenue not in monthly model | ~$33,000 | |
| **Adjusted Year 1 Retained Earnings** | **~$10,000** | |

**Honest interpretation:** On the conservative $285K monthly ramp model, retained earnings are technically negative after partner draws. Achieving the $325K target with overflow and per-push revenue restores positive retained earnings of ~$10,000-$25,000. Year 1 is a capital deployment year. Partners each take home ~$37,500 -- enough to survive, not enough to be comfortable.

### Cash Flow Milestones

| Milestone | When |
|-----------|------|
| First positive cash flow month | Month 4 (June) |
| Maximum cumulative deficit | -$12,218 (end of Month 3) |
| Cumulative break-even | Month 12 (February Year 2) |
| Year-end retained cash | +$10,178 (before tax) |

### Three-Year Projection

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Revenue | $285K-$325K | $500K-$600K | $750K-$1M |
| Gross margin | 59% | 48-52% | 42-48% |
| Partner income (each) | $37,500 | $55K-$75K | $80K-$120K |
| Crew size | 2-5 | 5-7 | 8-12 |
| Fleet value | $50K-$55K | $85K-$110K | $130K-$180K |

### Annual Break-Even Revenue

**$253,000.** The $285K-$325K target provides a 13-28% cushion above break-even.

### Monthly Break-Even with Partner Draws

**$24,105/month.** First exceeded in Month 7 (September at $26,850). Partners effectively subsidize the business from working capital reserves during Months 1-6.

2. Seasonal snow and ice management contract (with salt surcharge clause)
3. Estate mowing seasonal agreement
4. Subcontractor agreement (for overflow capacity)

**Attorney checklist budget: $2,400-$4,700** (contract review, operating agreement drafting, insurance certificate review, employment handbook)

### Employment Law

- Ohio minimum wage: $11/hour (January 2026; Stone & Salt budgets $18-$22/hour)
- Workers' compensation: Required through Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation before first hire
- Employee vs. independent contractor: Must classify correctly per Ohio and federal law; misclassification risk if using subcontractors regularly
- I-9 verification required for all hires

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

### Risk Hierarchy (Ordered by Severity)

| # | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Kill Trigger? |
|---|------|------------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **1** | **Slow commercial ramp (4 contracts vs. 8)** | Medium | Severe (-$28K Year 1) | Increase hardscape volume, reduce partner draws, extend timeline to 18 months. Front-load outreach. 20 named targets ready for Day 1. | YES -- 0 new contracts by Month 6 triggers pivot |
| **2** | **No hardscape projects materialize** | Low-Medium | Severe (-$60K Year 1) | Hardscape is the primary cash flow bridge in Months 1-6. If zero projects by Month 3, pivot to subcontract work, residential volume, or inject capital. | YES -- working capital depletion triggers emergency |
| **3** | **Partner exit at Month 6** | Low | High (-50% capacity) | Operating agreement with buyout provisions and shotgun clause. Business is survivable as a smaller operation but growth is capped. | YES -- irreconcilable disagreement after 30-day resolution window |
| **4** | **Salt price spike + heavy winter** | Medium | Moderate ($6K-$8K without surcharge) | Salt surcharge clause in every contract (non-negotiable). With clause, heavy winter is actually net positive due to per-push overflow. | NO -- manageable with contract protections |
| **5** | **Equipment failure (2-week peak season)** | Medium | Moderate ($5K-$9K) | Pre-arranged rental backup (zero-turn rental at $120/day). Rental sources identified. Client notification within 24 hours. | NO -- manageable with rental plan |
| **6** | **Insurance lapse or legal action** | Very Low | Critical | Stop all field work immediately until insurance is restored. A single uninsured work day voids all commercial contracts. | YES -- automatic field work halt |
| **7** | **Combined worst case** (slow ramp + no hardscape + salt spike) | Very Low | Fatal (-$72K) | This kills the business. Kill criteria trigger before reaching this point. The $62K buffer scenario provides the deepest cushion. | YES -- fatal |

### Combined Worst-Case Scenario

If slow commercial ramp AND no hardscape AND salt spike all occur simultaneously:

- Revenue: $158,000
- Costs: $230,000
- Year-end deficit: -$72,000

**This is the scenario where kill criteria should have triggered by Month 6, forcing a pivot well before the full deficit materializes.** The monthly checkpoint dashboard (Section 11B of the financial model) provides early warning: if cumulative revenue is under $70K by Month 6, action is required.

### Sensitivity Analysis Summary

| Scenario | Year-End Cash | vs. Base Case |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Base case** (8 contracts, hardscape on plan) | +$10,178 | -- |
| Slow commercial ramp (4 contracts) | -$28,422 | -$38,600 |
| No hardscape | -$49,822 | -$60,000 |
| Salt spike to $175/ton WITHOUT surcharge | +$2,178 | -$8,000 |
| Salt spike to $175/ton WITH surcharge | +$12,178 | +$2,000 |
| Combined worst case | -$72,000 | -$82,178 |

## 10. Agent Conflicts Identified & Resolutions

### Conflict 1: Equipment Strategy -- Tractor vs. Zero-Turn (RESOLVED)

- **CONCEPT-BRIEF.md** and **financial model v1** assumed buying a used sub-compact tractor ($16,500) as the primary equipment.
- **Deep equipment research** (research-equipment-tractors.md) concluded that a commercial zero-turn mower should be bought first -- saves $17,000-$23,000 over 5 years in operator time value.
- **Resolution:** Financial model v2 correctly budgets for a Scag Turf Tiger II 61" ($17,099, financed at 0%/48 months) as the Day 1 revenue tool, with tractor rented for $135-$203/day until utilization justifies purchase (Month 7-8 trigger).

### Conflict 2: Salt Cost Baseline -- $67-$75 vs. $96.40 (RESOLVED)

- **CONCEPT-BRIEF.md** listed bulk salt at $67/ton (DOT rate) and warned of $75-$140+ volatility.
- **Deep pricing research** identified Butler County procurement at $96.40/ton (May 2025) as the actual local benchmark.
- **Resolution:** Financial model v2 anchors all snow margin calculations on $96.40/ton baseline. Salt sensitivity table runs from $96 to $175/ton. Salt surcharge clause mandatory at $100/ton threshold.

### Conflict 3: Break-Even Definition -- Month 5 vs. Month 7 (RESOLVED)

- **Financial model v1** stated break-even at Month 7 in the executive summary but showed cumulative positive at Month 5 in the cash flow table.
- **Resolution:** Financial model v2 clearly distinguishes: monthly break-even (revenue > costs) in Month 4 (June); cumulative break-even (running balance crosses $0) in Month 12 (February). Both definitions are now explicit throughout.

### Conflict 4: Mike's Carwash Trust Signal -- Called For but Not Built (OPEN)

- **Brand copy audit (01)** explicitly called for "Trusted by Mike's Carwash" as the 4th hero trust bar signal.
- **Website** has only 3 trust signals: $2M Liability Coverage, Documented Service Logs, 4-Hour Response Guarantee. No Mike's Carwash reference anywhere.
- **Status:** OPEN. Requires: (1) confirmation that Mike's Carwash contract is signed, (2) permission from Mike's Carwash to use their name, (3) one code change to add to hero and snow page. Estimated effort: 15 minutes of code + 1 phone call.

### Conflict 5: Year 1 Revenue -- $325K Target vs. $285K Monthly Model (ACKNOWLEDGED)

- The **CONCEPT-BRIEF** and financial model both target $325,000 Year 1 revenue.
- The **monthly cash flow ramp** in financial model v2 totals $285,000.
- The $40,000 gap is accounted for as: estate mowing billing cycle overlap (~$14K), per-push snow overflow (~$6K), partial-month commercial billing (~$8K), maintenance churn/replace (~$5K), misc one-off work (~$7K).
- **Status:** This is not a conflict but it is important to understand. $285,000 is the modeled floor; $325,000 is the achievable target. Plan for $285K, hope for $325K.

### Conflict 6: Insurance Budget -- $3,000-$4,500 (Concept Brief) vs. $7,900-$12,700 (Legal/Compliance) (RESOLVED)

- The **CONCEPT-BRIEF** budget of $3,000-$4,500 was for GL insurance only.
- The **legal/compliance framework** correctly identifies the full insurance stack: GL + snow endorsement + commercial auto + inland marine + workers' comp = $7,900-$12,700/year.
- **Resolution:** Financial model v2 budgets $12,000/year ($1,000/month) for the full insurance stack, which falls within the legal/compliance range.

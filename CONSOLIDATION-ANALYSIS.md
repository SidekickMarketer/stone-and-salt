# Stone & Salt Consolidation Analysis
## Cross-Reference of All Existing Materials
### Generated: February 15, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

**What we have:** Extensive materials across multiple sources with significant strategic value but key gaps around pricing validation, timeline reality, and operational specifics.

**What we need:** Fresh validation of pricing assumptions, confirmation of equipment access, partner role clarity, and updated timeline (post-snow season pivot to spring focus).

**Decision:** GO — but with critical updates needed before full buildout.

### STILL SOLID ✓

| Finding | Source | Confidence | Notes |

| Hardscaping pricing structure | full-site-backup | MEDIUM | $2,500 - $50,000+ range seems reasonable |
| Year-round service positioning | Manus Strategy | HIGH | "Stone & Salt" name works for both snow + landscape |

### STALE OR SUSPECT ⚠️

| Finding | Source | Issue | Action Needed |
|---------|--------|-------|---------------|
| "Launch THIS WEEKEND" snow opportunity | Manus Strategy | Timeline passed (Jan 25 → Feb 15) | UPDATE: Pivot to spring landscaping messaging |
| Immediate revenue projections ($3K-8K first week) | Manus Strategy | Opportunity window closed | DISCARD: Not relevant post-season |
| Snow emergency pricing ($200-400/residential) | Manus Strategy | Season ending | VALIDATE: Standard seasonal rates vs emergency rates |
| Google Ads "emergency capacity" messaging | Launch Kit | No longer urgent | UPDATE: Shift to contract-based snow for next season |
| Year 1 revenue: $850K optimistic | Manus Strategy | Assumes aggressive growth | VALIDATE: Equipment access, partner commitment, crew capacity |
| "2 emergency slots tonight" urgency | Launch Kit | Outdated | ARCHIVE: Use as template for future storms |

### CONFLICTS WITH CONCEPT BRIEF ⚠️

| Conflict | Source A | Source B | Resolution |
|----------|----------|----------|------------|
| Service focus: Commercial-only vs Full-service | Local site (main), Launch Kit | full-site-backup branch, Strategy doc | **RESOLVE:** Full-service for spring, but lead with commercial |
| Pricing: Is it finalized? | SITE-NOTES: "not finalized with partner" | Strategy: Specific price ranges | **NEED INFO:** Partner discussion status? |
| Equipment: Owned vs Rented vs Partner-owned | Strategy mentions "tractors you have access to" | No clarity on ownership model | **NEED INFO:** Equipment access structure? |
| Phone number | (513) 555-0123 everywhere | Not real | **CRITICAL:** Get real number before launch |

## Updated Concept Brief

### The Problem
Homeowners and commercial property managers in Greater Cincinnati (particularly Oxford, Waynesville, Liberty Township) struggle to find reliable, professional property services. Existing providers are either:
- Seasonal-only (no year-round relationship)
- Commodity-priced with inconsistent quality
- Unable to handle large estate properties (10+ acres)
- Reactive rather than proactive in service delivery

### The Solution
**Stone & Salt Landscaping** — A premium, year-round property stewardship company offering:
- **Winter:** Commercial snow removal, residential driveways
- **Spring-Fall:** Estate mowing, landscape maintenance, hardscape design/installation
- **Value prop:** "Year-Round Property Stewardship" — one trusted partner for all outdoor needs

### The Customer
**Primary:** Affluent homeowners (Oxford, Waynesville, Mason, Liberty Township)
- Properties 1-30 acres
- Household income $100K+
- Value quality and reliability over lowest price
- Aging demographic (can't maintain large properties themselves)

**Secondary:** Commercial property managers
- HOAs, retail centers, corporate campuses
- Need reliable snow removal + grounds maintenance
- Contract-based relationships

### The Model
- **Service-based:** Per-job and contract pricing
- **Revenue tiers:**
  - Foundation: Mowing, maintenance, snow removal ($50K-150K Year 1)
  - Premium: Estate mowing, design services ($75K-200K Year 1)
  - Luxury: Hardscaping, outdoor living ($100K-500K Year 1)

### The Operator
**You** — Background/skills needed here:
- [FILL IN: Your relevant experience]
- [FILL IN: Existing assets/connections]
- Partner: [FILL IN: Partner role, skills, contribution]

### Known Constraints
- Geography: Greater Cincinnati (30-mile radius from base)
- Equipment: [FILL IN: What equipment access do you have?]
- Timeline: Snow season ending, spring launch critical
- Budget: [FILL IN: Available capital for launch]
- Partner: Pricing/role not finalized

### Open Questions (Critical)
1. **Partner status:** Role, equity, capital contribution, decision-making authority
2. **Equipment access:** What do you actually have? Owned? Partner-owned? Rental?
3. **Real phone number:** Get this immediately
4. **Pricing validation:** Have you talked to potential customers about prices?
5. **Legal structure:** LLC formed? Insurance obtained?
6. **Snow season results:** How much revenue actually generated? How many clients?
7. **Crew capacity:** Solo operator to start, or hiring immediately?

### Key Assumptions (Need Validation)
1. **Estate mowing demand:** 500-800 properties in target area need service
2. **Premium pricing viability:** Customers will pay 15-25% above commodity rates
3. **Cross-sell conversion:** 35-40% of snow clients convert to landscaping
4. **Equipment capacity:** Can service 15-25 estate mowing clients Year 1

### Design Problems to Solve
1. **Brand positioning:** How to communicate "premium" while remaining accessible?
2. **Service delivery:** Scheduling/route optimization for dispersed rural properties
3. **Trust/verification:** New company with no track record — how to build credibility?
4. **Seasonal transition:** Converting snow clients to landscaping contracts
5. **Sales process:** How do customers book? Quote? Pay?

### Future Vision (Don't Build Yet)
- Landscape architect partnerships
- Full design/build services
- Multiple crews
- Potential expansion to adjacent markets

## Recommended Research Prompts

### HIGH PRIORITY (Run First)

**1. Competitor Pricing Validation**
```
Research actual pricing for landscaping services in the Cincinnati 
metro area, specifically:
- Residential lawn mowing (1 acre properties)
- Estate mowing (10-30 acre properties) 
- Hardscaping (patios, retaining walls)
- Commercial snow removal (per-push and seasonal contract)

Visit competitor websites, call for quotes if possible, check 
Thumbtack/HomeAdvisor. Focus on premium providers in 
Liberty Township, Mason, West Chester, Oxford OH.

Report: Actual price ranges found, source for each, how they 
position (premium vs commodity).
```

**2. Equipment Cost Reality Check**
```
Research equipment options for estate mowing (10-30 acre properties):
- Compact tractor with mower attachment (buy vs lease)
- Commercial zero-turn mower capabilities and limits
- Typical equipment costs for servicing 15-25 estate properties

Focus on: What equipment is actually needed to service large 
properties efficiently? What does it cost to acquire?
```

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Run After)

**3. Local Landscaping Market Size**
```
Research the landscaping services market in the Cincinnati 
northern suburbs (Butler County, Warren County):
- Number of landscaping companies operating
- Any market concentration data
- Growth trends for 2024-2025
- Seasonal patterns and demand cycles
```

**4. Legal/Licensing Requirements**
```
Research business licensing and insurance requirements for 
landscaping companies in Ohio, specifically:
- Ohio business registration requirements
- Liability insurance minimums for landscaping/snow removal
- Any professional licenses required
- Workers comp requirements if hiring
```

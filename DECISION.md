## Stone & Salt | Commercial-Primary Grounds Management

---

**Date:** February 15, 2026

**Idea:** Stone & Salt -- Year-round commercial grounds management + integrated snow removal serving Greater Cincinnati's northern suburbs. 50/50 owner-operator partnership. Commercial-primary positioning with residential hardscape and estate mowing as secondary revenue.

**Decision:** CONDITIONAL GO

**Key reason:** The market is real ($500-700M serviceable), the positioning is validated and differentiated (whitespace on 8 of 12 brand dimensions vs. 10 audited competitors), the unit economics are strong (49-59% gross margin on commercial grounds, 55% on snow, LTV:CAC ratios of 100:1+), and the PE consolidation wave (Schill/TruArc January 2026, GroundsPRO/Visterra 2024) is creating vendor churn that benefits owner-operated alternatives. The financial model shows a viable path to $285K-$325K Year 1 revenue with cumulative break-even in Month 12. Partner income of ~$37,500 each is survivable. Year 2 projects $500K-$600K with partner income of $55K-$75K each. Year 3 projects $750K-$1M.

The model works if commercial contracts close at the projected pace. If they do not, kill criteria are defined and trigger a pivot before the deficit becomes fatal.

### Dealbreaker Check

| Dealbreaker | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Is there a market? | YES | $500-700M serviceable. 20 named target companies identified. Commercial LTV $95K-$375K per client. |
| Can we differentiate? | YES | Brand in whitespace on 8/12 dimensions. "Boots not brochure" voice unique. Documentation-first positioning unclaimed. PE consolidation creates counter-positioning opportunity. |
| Can we afford to start? | CONDITIONAL | $52K-$62K recommended startup capital. Must confirm capital availability. Partners already own 2 trucks, 2 plows, and a Bobcat ($0 equipment value contributed). |
| Is the math sound? | YES WITH CAVEATS | $285K floor model is conservative and achievable. $325K requires commercial contracts closing on pace. Combined worst case (-$72K) kills the business, but kill criteria trigger a pivot well before that point. The model is honest: Year 1 is a capital deployment year with ~$37,500/partner income. |
| Is the timing right? | YES | Spring launch is optimal. Snow season ending. Commercial budget decisions being made for next fiscal year. PE acquisitions creating vendor disruption NOW. LSA verification takes 3-4 weeks, so every day of delay costs lead generation time. |
| Can the team execute? | YES | Clear partner division: Partner 1 (sales/office), Partner 2 (field/equipment). Both full-time committed. Mike's Carwash contract provides Day 1 commercial reference. |

### Conditions for GO

All four must be true before committing:

1. **$52,000-$62,000 startup capital is available and committed** (can be a combination of cash, equipment contribution, and 0% equipment financing). Without this, the working capital cushion is too thin to survive the 3-6 month commercial sales cycle.

2. **LLC formation and $2M GL insurance are secured by March 1, 2026.** No commercial prospect will engage without proof of insurance. No proposal can be sent without a legal entity. These are table-stakes requirements, not optional.

3. **Commercial outreach begins by March 1, 2026.** The 3-6 month commercial sales cycle means every week of delay pushes the first new contract close further into summer. The 20 named target companies must be loaded into CRM and contacted in the first two weeks of March. Cold email domain warming must start immediately (14-21 day lead time).

4. **Operating agreement with buyout provisions is signed before any capital is deployed.** A 50/50 partnership without a written exit mechanism is a liability exposure that dwarfs any business risk. Must include: capital contribution records, buyout valuation method, shotgun clause, dispute resolution (mediation first), and HoldCo restructuring language for the future.

### What Happens if Conditions Are Not Met

| Missing Condition | Consequence |
|------------------|-------------|
| Capital not available | DO NOT LAUNCH. The model does not survive on minimal capital. The maximum cumulative deficit is -$12,218 by Month 3, and that assumes revenue starts flowing on schedule. Without $24K-$34K working capital reserve, one missed hardscape project or one delayed commercial contract creates a cash crisis. |
| Insurance not secured by March 1 | DELAY LAUNCH. Every commercial outreach without proof of insurance is wasted effort. Property managers will ask for a certificate of insurance before scheduling a site assessment. |
| Outreach does not start by March 1 | DELAY BREAK-EVEN. The financial model assumes first new commercial contract in Month 3-4 (May-June). Each month of delayed outreach pushes that to Month 4-5, 5-6, etc. The business can survive this but it extends the cumulative deficit period and reduces Year 1 revenue by $15K-$25K per month of delay. |
| No operating agreement | DO NOT DEPLOY CAPITAL. A 50/50 LLC without a written operating agreement is the #1 cause of partnership failure. One partner contributes $30K in cash and the other contributes $30K in equipment. Without written records, there is no basis for valuation, buyout, or dispute resolution. |

### Kill Criteria Summary

| # | Trigger | When | Action |
|---|---------|------|--------|
| 1 | Zero new commercial contracts (beyond Mike's) | Month 6 (August) | PIVOT to residential-primary |
| 2 | Cumulative revenue < $60K | Month 6 | ASSESS viability; inject capital or wind down |
| 3 | Working capital reserve hits $0 with negative monthly cash flow | Any month | EMERGENCY cost cutting; subcontract work for cash |
| 4 | 3+ service quality complaints in rolling 3-month period | Any time | PAUSE growth; fix delivery |
| 5 | Partner disagreement unresolvable within 30 days | Any time | MEDIATE; trigger buyout if unresolved |
| 6 | Total loss of primary equipment with no replacement in 5 days | Peak season | RENT immediately; subcontract if needed |
| 7 | Insurance lapse or lawsuit filed | Any time | STOP ALL FIELD WORK until resolved |

### Next Step

**Today (February 15):** Confirm startup capital availability. If capital is confirmed, execute the pre-launch checklist from `08-gtm-launch-calendar.md` starting with: (1) get a real 513 phone number, (2) file the LLC online ($99), (3) call 3 insurance brokers for $2M GL + commercial auto + WC quotes, (4) purchase the cold email domain and start warming.

**This week (Feb 15-21):** Complete all 15 blocking/high-priority pre-launch actions.

**By March 1:** LLC formed, insurance bound, GBP live, LSA submitted, CRM loaded with 20 targets, equipment purchased, vehicle signage installed, Jobber operational, proposal templates ready. Begin outreach.

### Confidence Level

**7/10.** The market, positioning, and unit economics are strong (would be 9/10 for those alone). Deductions: (1) no track record is a real barrier that only time and execution can overcome (-1), (2) Year 1 partner income of $37,500 is not comfortable and creates personal financial pressure (-1), (3) the combined worst case (-$72K) is real even if unlikely (-1). The business has a viable path, but it is not a guaranteed path. Execution discipline, pipeline management, and honest monthly checkpoints are what separate the viable path from the fatal one.

# Stone & Salt Agent Team Kickoff
## Audit, Refine & Build | Commercial-Primary

---

## Mission

Audit existing brand/copy for commercial-primary fit, update financial model, and build the website.

**Goal:** Launch-ready business by March 1, 2026.

---

## Context

**The Business:**
Stone & Salt is a year-round grounds management company. We're pivoting from balanced residential/commercial to **commercial-primary** based on research showing higher LTV ($95K-$375K), more predictable revenue (annual contracts), and clearer differentiation.

**Mike's Carwash:**
✅ **SIGNED commercial contract** - validates pricing model, use as proof element.

**Equipment Strategy (from research):**
- Buy used: John Deere 1025R or Kubota BX2380
- Target: $16,000-17,000 (200-300 hours, loader + 60" mower)
- Deploy by March 1 for estate mowing season

**Locked Elements:**
- Name: Stone & Salt
- Colors: Slate #2A2A2A, Eucalyptus #B3C3AD, Sun-Ochre #D5A056, Soft Cream #F6F4F1
- Pricing: From PRICING_BENCHMARKS.md (validated)
- Voice: Professional, grounded, warm, sharp ("boots not brochure")

```markdown
## Brand Audit Report

### Current State (from BRAND_BIBLE.md)
- Tagline: "Four seasons. One call."
- Voice: Professional, grounded, warm, sharp
- Positioning: Year-round outdoor partner

### Commercial-Primary Fit Assessment
| Element | Residential Fit | Commercial Fit | Recommendation |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Tagline | Good | Good | KEEP |
| "Four seasons. One call." | Clear value | Clear value (vendor consolidation) | KEEP |
| Voice - Professional | Good | Excellent | KEEP |
| Voice - Warm | Good | May soften | ADJUST for B2B |
| "Boots not brochure" | Excellent | Excellent | KEEP |

### Required Adjustments for B2B
- More emphasis on: liability, documentation, predictability, budget certainty
- Less emphasis on: beauty, aesthetics, outdoor living
- Keywords to add: documented, liability protection, response time guarantee, annual contract
```

**2. Copy Audit & Refinement**

Audit SNOW_LANDING_PAGE.md and refine for commercial-primary:

**Homepage Hero:**
- Current: "Your Property. Cleared Before You Wake Up."
- Assess: Does this speak to property managers?
- Refine if needed: Emphasize liability, predictability, vendor consolidation

**Service Hierarchy:**
1. Commercial Grounds Maintenance (priority)
2. Snow & Ice Removal
3. Hardscapes ("For Properties That Need More")
4. Residential ("Select Residential When Capacity Allows")

**CTAs:**
- Change "Claim Your Snow Contract" → "Request Site Assessment" (commercial language)
- Change "Lock In Residential Pricing" → "Get Commercial Quote"

**3. Property Manager Email Sequence (3 emails)**

Write cold outreach sequence for property managers:

**Email 1: Pain Point Recognition**
- Subject: Managing multiple vendors?
- Hook: "Still coordinating separate landscapers and snow removal?"
- Problem: Vendor fragmentation, liability gaps, budget chaos
- Soft CTA: Worth a conversation?

**Email 2: Solution + Proof**
- Subject: How [similar property] simplified grounds management
- Mike's Carwash mention: "We just partnered with Mike's Carwash..."
- Solution: One vendor, four seasons, documented service
- CTA: 15-minute call to discuss your properties

**Email 3: Urgency + Direct Ask**
- Subject: Spring booking opens March 1
- Scarcity: Limited commercial capacity
- Direct ask: Schedule site assessment this week
- CTA: Calendar link

**4. Refined Copy Document**

**5. Risk Factors & Mitigation**

```markdown
# Risk Assessment

## High Risk: 3-6 Month Commercial Sales Cycle
**Impact:** Months 1-3 operating at loss
**Mitigation:** Start outreach immediately; use Mike's Carwash as reference

## Medium Risk: Labor Shortage
**Impact:** Can't scale to meet demand
**Mitigation:** Premium wages; year-round employment (not seasonal)

## Medium Risk: Equipment Breakdown
**Impact:** Service delays
**Mitigation:** Preventive maintenance; dealer relationship for quick parts

## Low Risk: Weather (Snow)
**Impact:** Cincinnati only 15-23" snow/year
**Mitigation:** Snow is supplementary; don't build model on snow revenue

## Key Assumptions That Must Hold
- [ ] Can win 6-8 commercial contracts by end of Q2
- [ ] Close rate on proposals > 15%
- [ ] 90% client retention
- [ ] Equipment acquired by March 1
